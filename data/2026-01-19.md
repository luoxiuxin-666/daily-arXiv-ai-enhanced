Abstract: Massively Multiplayer Online (MMO) game servers must handle thousands of simultaneous players while maintaining sub-100ms response times. When server load exceeds capacity, traditional approaches either uniformly throttle all message types regardless of importance (damaging gameplay) or apply fixed heuristic rules that fail to adapt to dynamic workloads. This paper presents AFLL (Adaptive Feedback Loop Learning), a real-time load stabilization system that learns the causal relationship between outgoing server messages and subsequent incoming client requests. AFLL employs backpropagation to continuously adjust message type weights, enabling predictive throttling that blocks low-priority messages before overload occurs while guaranteeing critical message delivery. Through controlled experiments with 1,000 concurrent players, AFLL reduced average CPU time by 48.3% (13.2ms to 6.8ms), peak CPU time by 51.7% (54.0ms to 26.1ms), and thread contention by 64.4% (19.6% to 7.0%), while maintaining zero learning overhead through background computation and caching optimizations. The system achieved remarkable reproducibility (CV < 2% across all metrics) and identified a three-stage causal chain linking message blocking to load reduction. AFLL demonstrates that circular causality learning enables practical real-time adaptation for latency-critical systems.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) has become a central paradigm in serverless cloud computing, yet optimizing FaaS deployments remains challenging. Using function fusion, multiple functions can be combined into a single deployment unit, which can be used to reduce cost and latency of complex serverless applications comprising multiple functions. Even in small-scale applications, the number of possible fusion configurations is vast, making brute-force benchmarking in production both cost- and time-prohibitive.
  In this paper, we present a system that can analyze every possible fusion setup of complex applications. By emulating the FaaS platform, our system enables local experimentation, eliminating the need to reconfigure the live platform and significantly reducing associated cost and time. We evaluate all fusion configurations across a number of example FaaS applications and resource limits. Our results reveal that, when analyzing cost and latency trade-offs, only a limited set of fusion configurations represent optimal solutions, which are strongly influenced by the specific pricing model in use.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Message delivery respecting causal ordering (causal delivery) is one of the most classic and widely useful abstraction for inter-process communication in a distributed system. Most approaches tag messages with causality information and buffer them at the receiver until they can be safely delivered. Except for specific approaches that exploit communication topology, therefore not generally applicable, they incur a metadata overhead which is prohibitive for a large number of processes. Much less used are the approaches that enforce causal order by buffering messages at the sender, until it is safe to release them to the network, as the classic algorithm has too many drawbacks. In this paper, first we discuss the limitations of sender-only buffering approaches and introduce the Sender Permission to Send (SPS) enforcement strategy, showing that SPS + FIFO implies Causal. We analyze a recent sender-buffering algorithm, Cykas, which follows SPS + FIFO, albeit very conservatively, pointing out throughput scalability and liveness issues. Then, we introduce a novel SPS + FIFO based algorithm, which adopts a new hybrid approach: enforcing causality by combining sender-buffering to enforce SPS and receiver-buffering to enforce FIFO. The algorithm overcomes limitations of sender-only buffering, and achieves effectively constant metadata size per message. By a careful choice of data-structures, the algorithm is also computationally-optimal, with amortized effectively constant processing overhead. As far as we know, there is no other topology-agnostic causal delivery algorithm with these properties.

Abstract: This paper addresses the joint optimization of trajectories and bandwidth allocation for multiple Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to enhance energy efficiency in the cooperative data collection problem. We focus on an important yet underestimated aspect of the system, where action synchronization across all UAVs is impossible. Since most existing learning-based solutions are not designed to learn in this asynchronous environment, we formulate the trajectory planning problem as a Decentralized Partially Observable Semi-Markov Decision Process and introduce an asynchronous multi-agent learning algorithm to learn UAVs' cooperative policies. Once the UAVs' trajectory policies are learned, the bandwidth allocation can be optimally solved based on local observations at each collection point. Comprehensive empirical results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over other learning-based and heuristic baselines in terms of both energy efficiency and mission completion time. Additionally, the learned policies exhibit robustness under varying environmental conditions.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: This report studies whether small, tool-augmented agents can match or outperform larger monolithic models on the GAIA benchmark. Using Qwen3 models (4B-32B) within an adapted Agentic-Reasoning framework, we isolate the effects of model scale, explicit thinking (no thinking, planner-only, or full), and tool use (search, code, mind-map). Tool augmentation provides the largest and most consistent gains. Using tools, 4B models can outperform 32B models without tool access on GAIA in our experimental setup. In contrast, explicit thinking is highly configuration- and difficulty-dependent: planner-only thinking can improve decomposition and constraint tracking, while unrestricted full thinking often degrades performance by destabilizing tool orchestration, leading to skipped verification steps, excessive tool calls, non-termination, and output-format drift.

Abstract: In this paper, we consider a matroid generalization of the stable matching problem. In particular, we consider the setting where preferences may contain ties.

Abstract: Multi-agent LLM ensembles can converge on coordinated, socially harmful equilibria. This paper advances an experimental framework for evaluating Institutional AI, our system-level approach to AI alignment that reframes alignment from preference engineering in agent-space to mechanism design in institution-space. Central to this approach is the governance graph, a public, immutable manifest that declares legal states, transitions, sanctions, and restorative paths; an Oracle/Controller runtime interprets this manifest, attaching enforceable consequences to evidence of coordination while recording a cryptographically keyed, append-only governance log for audit and provenance. We apply the Institutional AI framework to govern the Cournot collusion case documented by prior work and compare three regimes: Ungoverned (baseline incentives from the structure of the Cournot market), Constitutional (a prompt-only policy-as-prompt prohibition implemented as a fixed written anti-collusion constitution, and Institutional (governance-graph-based). Across six model configurations including cross-provider pairs (N=90 runs/condition), the Institutional regime produces large reductions in collusion: mean tier falls from 3.1 to 1.8 (Cohen's d=1.28), and severe-collusion incidence drops from 50% to 5.6%. The prompt-only Constitutional baseline yields no reliable improvement, illustrating that declarative prohibitions do not bind under optimisation pressure. These results suggest that multi-agent alignment may benefit from being framed as an institutional design problem, where governance graphs can provide a tractable abstraction for alignment-relevant collective behavior.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Ensuring fairness while limiting costs, such as transportation or storage, is an important challenge in resource allocation, yet most work has focused on cost minimization without fairness or fairness without explicit cost considerations. We introduce and formally define the minCost-EFx Allocation problem, where the objective is to compute an allocation that is envy-free up to any item (EFx) and has minimum cost. We investigate the algorithmic complexity of this problem, proving that it is NP-hard already with two agents. On the positive side, we show that the problem admits a polynomial kernel with respect to the number of items, implying that a core source of intractability lies in the number of items. Building on this, we identify parameter-restricted settings that are tractable, including cases with bounded valuations and a constant number of agents, or a limited number of item types under restricted cost models. Finally, we turn to cost approximation, proving that for any $ρ>1$ the problem is not $ρ$-approximable in polynomial time (unless $P=NP$), while also identifying restricted cost models where costs are agent-specific and independent of the actual items received, which admit better approximation guarantees.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search (ALNS) is a widely used heuristic method for solving combinatorial optimization problems. ALNS explores the solution space by iteratively using destroy and repair operators with probabilities, which are adjusted by an adaptive mechanism to find optimal solutions. However, the classic ALNS adaptive mechanism does not consider the interaction between destroy and repair operators when selecting them. To overcome this limitation, this study proposes a novel adaptive mechanism. This mechanism enhances the adaptability of the algorithm through a Dual Actor-Critic (DAC) model, which fully considers the fact that the quality of new solutions is jointly determined by the destroy and repair operators. It effectively utilizes the interaction between these operators during the weight adjustment process, greatly improving the adaptability of the ALNS algorithm. In this mechanism, the destroy and repair processes are modeled as independent Markov Decision Processes to guide the selection of operators more accurately. Furthermore, we use Graph Neural Networks to extract key features from problem instances and perform effective aggregation and normalization to enhance the algorithm's transferability to different sizes and characteristics of problems. Through a series of experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed DAC-ALNS algorithm significantly improves solution efficiency and exhibits excellent transferability.

Abstract: The integration of AI agents into economic markets fundamentally alters the landscape of strategic interaction. We investigate the economic implications of expanding the set of available technologies in three canonical game-theoretic settings: bargaining (resource division), negotiation (asymmetric information trade), and persuasion (strategic information transmission). We find that simply increasing the choice of AI delegates can drastically shift equilibrium payoffs and regulatory outcomes, often creating incentives for regulators to proactively develop and release technologies. Conversely, we identify a strategic phenomenon termed the "Poisoned Apple" effect: an agent may release a new technology, which neither they nor their opponent ultimately uses, solely to manipulate the regulator's choice of market design in their favor. This strategic release improves the releaser's welfare at the expense of their opponent and the regulator's fairness objectives. Our findings demonstrate that static regulatory frameworks are vulnerable to manipulation via technology expansion, necessitating dynamic market designs that adapt to the evolving landscape of AI capabilities.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: A key challenge in designing normalizing flows is finding expressive scalar bijections that remain invertible with tractable Jacobians. Existing approaches face trade-offs: affine transformations are smooth and analytically invertible but lack expressivity; monotonic splines offer local control but are only piecewise smooth and act on bounded domains; residual flows achieve smoothness but need numerical inversion. We introduce three families of analytic bijections -- cubic rational, sinh, and cubic polynomial -- that are globally smooth ($C^\infty$), defined on all of $\mathbb{R}$, and analytically invertible in closed form, combining the favorable properties of all prior approaches. These bijections serve as drop-in replacements in coupling flows, matching or exceeding spline performance. Beyond coupling layers, we develop radial flows: a novel architecture using direct parametrization that transforms the radial coordinate while preserving angular direction. Radial flows exhibit exceptional training stability, produce geometrically interpretable transformations, and on targets with radial structure can achieve comparable quality to coupling flows with $1000\times$ fewer parameters. We provide comprehensive evaluation on 1D and 2D benchmarks, and demonstrate applicability to higher-dimensional physics problems through experiments on $φ^4$ lattice field theory, where our bijections outperform affine baselines and enable problem-specific designs that address mode collapse.

Abstract: Transfer learning plays a vital role in improving model performance in data-scarce scenarios. However, naive uniform transfer from multiple source tasks may result in negative transfer, highlighting the need to properly balance the contributions of heterogeneous sources. Moreover, existing transfer learning methods typically focus on optimizing either the source weights or the amount of transferred samples, while largely neglecting the joint consideration of the other. In this work, we propose a theoretical framework, Unified Optimization of Weights and Quantities (UOWQ), which formulates multi-source transfer learning as a parameter estimation problem grounded in an asymptotic analysis of a Kullback-Leibler divergence-based generalization error measure. The proposed framework jointly determines the optimal source weights and optimal transfer quantities for each source task. Firstly, we prove that using all available source samples is always optimal once the weights are properly adjusted, and we provide a theoretical explanation for this phenomenon. Moreover, to determine the optimal transfer weights, our analysis yields closed-form solutions in the single-source setting and develops a convex optimization-based numerical procedure for the multi-source case. Building on the theoretical results, we further propose practical algorithms for both multi-source transfer learning and multi-task learning settings. Extensive experiments on real-world benchmarks, including DomainNet and Office-Home, demonstrate that UOWQ consistently outperforms strong baselines. The results validate both the theoretical predictions and the practical effectiveness of our framework.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Recent advances in code generation models have unlocked unprecedented opportunities for automating feature engineering, yet their adoption in real-world ML teams remains constrained by critical challenges: (i) the scarcity of datasets capturing the iterative and complex coding processes of production-level feature engineering, (ii) limited integration and personalization of widely used coding agents, such as CoPilot and Devin, with a team's unique tools, codebases, workflows, and practices, and (iii) suboptimal human-AI collaboration due to poorly timed or insufficient feedback. We address these challenges with a planner-guided, constrained-topology multi-agent framework that generates code for repositories in a multi-step fashion. The LLM-powered planner leverages a team's environment, represented as a graph, to orchestrate calls to available agents, generate context-aware prompts, and use downstream failures to retroactively correct upstream artifacts. It can request human intervention at critical steps, ensuring generated code is reliable, maintainable, and aligned with team expectations. On a novel in-house dataset, our approach achieves 38% and 150% improvement in the evaluation metric over manually crafted and unplanned workflows respectively. In practice, when building features for recommendation models serving over 120 million users, our approach has delivered real-world impact by reducing feature engineering cycles from three weeks to a single day.

Abstract: We present a systematic study of Tensor Network (TN) models $\unicode{x2013}$ Matrix Product States (MPS) and Tree Tensor Networks (TTN) $\unicode{x2013}$ for real-time jet tagging in high-energy physics, with a focus on low-latency deployment on Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). Motivated by the strict requirements of the HL-LHC Level-1 trigger system, we explore TNs as compact and interpretable alternatives to deep neural networks. Using low-level jet constituent features, our models achieve competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art deep learning classifiers. We investigate post-training quantization to enable hardware-efficient implementations without degrading classification performance or latency. The best-performing models are synthesized to estimate FPGA resource usage, latency, and memory occupancy, demonstrating sub-microsecond latency and supporting the feasibility of online deployment in real-time trigger systems. Overall, this study highlights the potential of TN-based models for fast and resource-efficient inference in low-latency environments.

Abstract: Value level parallelism (VLP) has been proposed to improve the efficiency of large-batch, low-precision general matrix multiply (GEMM) between symmetric activations and weights. In transformer based large language models (LLMs), there exist more sophisticated operations beyond activation-weight GEMM. In this paper, we explore how VLP benefits LLMs. First, we generalize VLP for nonlinear approximations, outperforming existing nonlinear approximations in end-to-end LLM accuracy, performance, and efficiency. Our VLP approximation follows a value-centric approach, where important values are assigned with greater accuracy. Second, we optimize VLP for small-batch GEMMs with asymmetric inputs efficiently, which leverages timely LLM optimizations, including weight-only quantization, key-value (KV) cache quantization, and group query attention. Finally, we design a new VLP architecture, Mugi, to encapsulate the innovations above and support full LLM workloads, while providing better performance, efficiency and sustainability. Our experimental results show that Mugi can offer significant improvements on throughput and energy efficiency, up to $45\times$ and $668\times$ for nonlinear softmax operations, and $2.07\times$ and $3.11\times$ for LLMs, and also decrease operational carbon for LLM operation by $1.45\times$ and embodied carbon by $1.48\times$.

Abstract: Inverse design tools such as Topology Optimization (TO) can achieve new levels of improvement for high-performance engineered structures. However, widespread use is hindered by high computational times and a black-box nature that inhibits user interaction. Human-in-the-loop TO approaches are emerging that integrate human intuition into the design generation process. However, these rely on the time-consuming bottleneck of iterative region selection for design modifications. To reduce the number of iterative trials, this contribution presents an AI co-pilot that uses machine learning to predict the user's preferred regions. The prediction model is configured as an image segmentation task with a U-Net architecture. It is trained on synthetic datasets where human preferences either identify the longest topological member or the most complex structural connection. The model successfully predicts plausible regions for modification and presents them to the user as AI recommendations. The human preference model demonstrates generalization across diverse and non-standard TO problems and exhibits emergent behavior outside the single-region selection training data. Demonstration examples show that the new human-in-the-loop TO approach that integrates the AI co-pilot can improve manufacturability or improve the linear buckling load by 39% while only increasing the total design time by 15 sec compared to conventional simplistic TO.

Abstract: Traditional time series forecasting methods optimize for accuracy alone. This objective neglects temporal consistency, in other words, how consistently a model predicts the same future event as the forecast origin changes. We introduce the forecast accuracy and coherence score (forecast AC score for short) for measuring the quality of probabilistic multi-horizon forecasts in a way that accounts for both multi-horizon accuracy and stability. Our score additionally provides for user-specified weights to balance accuracy and consistency requirements. As an example application, we implement the score as a differentiable objective function for training seasonal ARIMA models and evaluate it on the M4 Hourly benchmark dataset. Results demonstrate substantial improvements over traditional maximum likelihood estimation. Our AC-optimized models achieve a 75\% reduction in forecast volatility for the same target timestamps while maintaining comparable or improved point forecast accuracy.

Abstract: Deep neural networks constructed from linear maps and positively homogeneous nonlinearities (e.g., ReLU) possess a fundamental gauge symmetry: the network function is invariant to node-wise diagonal rescalings. However, standard gradient descent is not equivariant to this symmetry, causing optimization trajectories to depend heavily on arbitrary parameterizations. Prior work has proposed rescaling-invariant optimization schemes for positively homogeneous networks (e.g., path-based or path-space updates). Our contribution is complementary: we formulate the invariance requirement at the level of the backward adjoint/optimization geometry, which provides a simple, operator-level recipe that can be applied uniformly across network components and optimizer state. By replacing the Euclidean transpose with a Unit-Consistent (UC) adjoint, we derive UC gauge-consistent steepest descent and backprogation.

Abstract: Numerous offline and model-based reinforcement learning systems incorporate world models to emulate the inherent environments. A world model is particularly important in scenarios where direct interactions with the real environment is costly, dangerous, or impractical. The efficacy and interpretability of such world models are notably contingent upon the quality of the underlying training data. In this context, we introduce Action Shapley as an agnostic metric for the judicious and unbiased selection of training data. To facilitate the computation of Action Shapley, we present a randomized dynamic algorithm specifically designed to mitigate the exponential complexity inherent in traditional Shapley value computations. Through empirical validation across five data-constrained real-world case studies, the algorithm demonstrates a computational efficiency improvement exceeding 80\% in comparison to conventional exponential time computations. Furthermore, our Action Shapley-based training data selection policy consistently outperforms ad-hoc training data selection.

Abstract: Sustainability is becoming increasingly critical in the maritime transport, encompassing both environmental and social impacts, such as Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions and navigational safety. Traditional vessel navigation heavily relies on human experience, often lacking autonomy and emission awareness, and is prone to human errors that may compromise safety. In this paper, we propose a Curriculum Reinforcement Learning (CRL) framework integrated with a realistic, data-driven marine simulation environment and a machine learning-based fuel consumption prediction module. The simulation environment is constructed using real-world vessel movement data and enhanced with a Diffusion Model to simulate dynamic maritime conditions. Vessel fuel consumption is estimated using historical operational data and learning-based regression. The surrounding environment is represented as image-based inputs to capture spatial complexity. We design a lightweight, policy-based CRL agent with a comprehensive reward mechanism that considers safety, emissions, timeliness, and goal completion. This framework effectively handles complex tasks progressively while ensuring stable and efficient learning in continuous action spaces. We validate the proposed approach in a sea area of the Indian Ocean, demonstrating its efficacy in enabling sustainable and safe vessel navigation.

Abstract: Learning physically meaningful spatiotemporal representations from high-resolution multivariate Earth observation data is challenging due to strong local dynamics, long-range teleconnections, multi-scale interactions, and nonstationarity. While ConvLSTM2D is a commonly used baseline, its dense convolutional gating incurs high computational cost and its strictly local receptive fields limit the modeling of long-range spatial structure and disentangled climate dynamics. To address these limitations, we propose FAConvLSTM, a Factorized-Attention ConvLSTM layer designed as a drop-in replacement for ConvLSTM2D that simultaneously improves efficiency, spatial expressiveness, and physical interpretability. FAConvLSTM factorizes recurrent gate computations using lightweight [1 times 1] bottlenecks and shared depthwise spatial mixing, substantially reducing channel complexity while preserving recurrent dynamics. Multi-scale dilated depthwise branches and squeeze-and-excitation recalibration enable efficient modeling of interacting physical processes across spatial scales, while peephole connections enhance temporal precision. To capture teleconnection-scale dependencies without incurring global attention cost, FAConvLSTM incorporates a lightweight axial spatial attention mechanism applied sparsely in time. A dedicated subspace head further produces compact per timestep embeddings refined through temporal self-attention with fixed seasonal positional encoding. Experiments on multivariate spatiotemporal climate data shows superiority demonstrating that FAConvLSTM yields more stable, interpretable, and robust latent representations than standard ConvLSTM, while significantly reducing computational overhead.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Split learning (SL) enables collaborative training of large language models (LLMs) between resource-constrained edge devices and compute-rich servers by partitioning model computation across the network boundary. However, existing SL systems predominantly rely on first-order (FO) optimization, which requires clients to store intermediate quantities such as activations for backpropagation. This results in substantial memory overhead, largely negating benefits of model partitioning. In contrast, zeroth-order (ZO) optimization eliminates backpropagation and significantly reduces memory usage, but often suffers from slow convergence and degraded performance. In this work, we propose HOSL, a novel Hybrid-Order Split Learning framework that addresses this fundamental trade-off between memory efficiency and optimization effectiveness by strategically integrating ZO optimization on the client side with FO optimization on the server side. By employing memory-efficient ZO gradient estimation at the client, HOSL eliminates backpropagation and activation storage, reducing client memory consumption. Meanwhile, server-side FO optimization ensures fast convergence and competitive performance. Theoretically, we show that HOSL achieves a $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{d_c/TQ})$ rate, which depends on client-side model dimension $d_c$ rather than the full model dimension $d$, demonstrating that convergence improves as more computation is offloaded to the server. Extensive experiments on OPT models (125M and 1.3B parameters) across 6 tasks demonstrate that HOSL reduces client GPU memory by up to 3.7$\times$ compared to the FO method while achieving accuracy within 0.20%-4.23% of this baseline. Furthermore, HOSL outperforms the ZO baseline by up to 15.55%, validating the effectiveness of our hybrid strategy for memory-efficient training on edge devices.

Abstract: The increasing integration of renewable energy sources (RESs) into modern power systems presents significant opportunities but also notable challenges, primarily due to the inherent variability of RES generation. Accurate forecasting of RES generation is crucial for maintaining the reliability, stability, and economic efficiency of power system operations. Traditional approaches, such as deterministic methods and stochastic programming, frequently depend on representative scenarios generated through clustering techniques like K-means. However, these methods may fail to fully capture the complex temporal dependencies and non-linear patterns within RES data. This paper introduces a multivariate Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)-based network designed to forecast RESs generation using their real-world historical data. The proposed model effectively captures long-term dependencies and interactions between different RESs, utilizing historical data from both local and neighboring areas to enhance predictive accuracy. In the case study, we showed that the proposed forecasting approach results in lower CO2 emissions, and a more reliable supply of electric loads.

Abstract: Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is central to deep learning, yet the dynamical origin of its preference for flatter, more generalizable solutions remains unclear. Here, by analyzing SGD learning dynamics, we identify a nonequilibrium mechanism governing solution selection. Numerical experiments reveal a transient exploratory phase in which SGD trajectories repeatedly escape sharp valleys and transition toward flatter regions of the loss landscape. By using a tractable physical model, we show that the SGD noise reshapes the landscape into an effective potential that favors flat solutions. Crucially, we uncover a transient freezing mechanism: as training proceeds, growing energy barriers suppress inter-valley transitions and ultimately trap the dynamics within a single basin. Increasing the SGD noise strength delays this freezing, which enhances convergence to flatter minima. Together, these results provide a unified physical framework linking learning dynamics, loss-landscape geometry, and generalization, and suggest principles for the design of more effective optimization algorithms.

Abstract: Restoring critical loads after extreme events demands adaptive control to maintain distribution-grid resilience, yet uncertainty in renewable generation, limited dispatchable resources, and nonlinear dynamics make effective restoration difficult. Reinforcement learning (RL) can optimize sequential decisions under uncertainty, but standard RL often generalizes poorly and requires extensive retraining for new outage configurations or generation patterns. We propose a meta-guided gradient-free RL (MGF-RL) framework that learns a transferable initialization from historical outage experiences and rapidly adapts to unseen scenarios with minimal task-specific tuning. MGF-RL couples first-order meta-learning with evolutionary strategies, enabling scalable policy search without gradient computation while accommodating nonlinear, constrained distribution-system dynamics. Experiments on IEEE 13-bus and IEEE 123-bus test systems show that MGF-RL outperforms standard RL, MAML-based meta-RL, and model predictive control across reliability, restoration speed, and adaptation efficiency under renewable forecast errors. MGF-RL generalizes to unseen outages and renewable patterns while requiring substantially fewer fine-tuning episodes than conventional RL. We also provide sublinear regret bounds that relate adaptation efficiency to task similarity and environmental variation, supporting the empirical gains and motivating MGF-RL for real-time load restoration in renewable-rich distribution grids.

Abstract: We study whether lightweight symbolic reasoning supervision can improve fix type classification in compact automated program repair models. Small code models are attractive for resource-constrained settings, but they typically produce only a single prediction, making it unclear whether they learn meaningful program structure or rely on shallow correlations. We propose a reasoning distillation approach in which a large teacher model provides structured symbolic reasoning tags alongside fix-type labels. These tags capture high-level causal properties of bugs without relying on free-form explanations. We train a CodeT5-based student model under label-only and reasoning-distilled settings on the IntroClass benchmark. Reasoning supervision consistently improves macro averaged performance, particularly on less frequent bug categories, without increasing model size or complexity. We further analyze the relationship between reasoning accuracy and fix-type prediction, showing that correct reasoning traces strongly correlate with correct predictions, while not fully determining them. Our results suggest that symbolic reasoning distillation is a practical way to improve interpretability and robustness in lightweight program repair models.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Constant rescaling of a Riemannian metric appears in many computational settings, often through a global scale parameter that is introduced either explicitly or implicitly. Although this operation is elementary, its consequences are not always made clear in practice and may be confused with changes in curvature, manifold structure, or coordinate representation. In this note we provide a short, self-contained account of constant metric scaling on arbitrary Riemannian manifolds. We distinguish between quantities that change under such a scaling, including norms, distances, volume elements, and gradient magnitudes, and geometric objects that remain invariant, such as the Levi--Civita connection, geodesics, exponential and logarithmic maps, and parallel transport. We also discuss implications for Riemannian optimization, where constant metric scaling can often be interpreted as a global rescaling of step sizes rather than a modification of the underlying geometry. The goal of this note is purely expository and is intended to clarify how a global metric scale parameter can be introduced in Riemannian computation without altering the geometric structures on which these methods rely.

Abstract: Contrastive learning has become a leading self- supervised approach to representation learning across domains, including vision, multimodal settings, graphs, and federated learning. However, recent studies have shown that contrastive learning is susceptible to backdoor and data poisoning attacks. In these attacks, adversaries can manipulate pretraining data or model updates to insert hidden malicious behavior. This paper offers a thorough and comparative review of backdoor attacks in contrastive learning. It analyzes threat models, attack methods, target domains, and available defenses. We summarize recent advancements in this area, underline the specific vulnerabilities inherent to contrastive learning, and discuss the challenges and future research directions. Our findings have significant implications for the secure deployment of systems in industrial and distributed environments.

Abstract: Interpretable graph learning has recently emerged as a popular research topic in machine learning. The goal is to identify the important nodes and edges of an input graph that are crucial for performing a specific graph reasoning task. A number of studies have been conducted in this area, and various benchmark datasets have been proposed to facilitate evaluation. Among them, one of the most challenging is the Spurious-Motif benchmark, introduced at ICLR 2022. The datasets in this synthetic benchmark are deliberately designed to include spurious correlations, making it particularly difficult for models to distinguish truly relevant structures from misleading patterns. As a result, existing methods exhibit significantly worse performance on this benchmark compared to others.
  In this paper, we focus on improving interpretability on the challenging Spurious-Motif datasets. We demonstrate that the self-reflection technique, commonly used in large language models to tackle complex tasks, can also be effectively adapted to enhance interpretability in datasets with strong spurious correlations. Specifically, we propose a self-reflection framework that can be integrated with existing interpretable graph learning methods. When such a method produces importance scores for each node and edge, our framework feeds these predictions back into the original method to perform a second round of evaluation. This iterative process mirrors how large language models employ self-reflective prompting to reassess their previous outputs. We further analyze the reasons behind this improvement from the perspective of graph representation learning, which motivates us to propose a fine-tuning training method based on this feedback mechanism.

Abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) refers to adapting a classifier for the test data when the probability distribution of the test data slightly differs from that of the training data of the model. To the best of our knowledge, most of the existing TTA approaches modify the weights of the classifier relying heavily on the architecture. It is unclear as to how these approaches are extendable to generic architectures. In this article, we propose an architecture-agnostic approach to TTA by adding an adapter network pre-processing the input images suitable to the classifier. This adapter is trained using the proposed quantile loss. Unlike existing approaches, we correct for the distribution shift by matching high-dimensional geometric quantiles. We prove theoretically that under suitable conditions minimizing quantile loss can learn the optimal adapter. We validate our approach on CIFAR10-C, CIFAR100-C and TinyImageNet-C by training both classic convolutional and transformer networks on CIFAR10, CIFAR100 and TinyImageNet datasets.

Abstract: The accurate identification of antiviral peptides (AVPs) is crucial for novel drug development. However, existing methods still have limitations in capturing complex sequence dependencies and distinguishing confusing samples with high similarity. To address these challenges, we propose AVP-Pro, a novel two-stage predictive framework that integrates adaptive feature fusion and contrastive learning. To comprehensively capture the physicochemical properties and deep-seated patterns of peptide sequences, we constructed a panoramic feature space encompassing 10 distinct descriptors and designed a hierarchical fusion architecture. This architecture integrates self-attention and adaptive gating mechanisms to dynamically modulate the weights of local motifs extracted by CNNs and global dependencies captured by BiLSTMs based on sequence context. Targeting the blurred decision boundary caused by the high similarity between positive and negative sample sequences, we adopted an Online Hard Example Mining (OHEM)-driven contrastive learning strategy enhanced by BLOSUM62. This approach significantly sharpened the model's discriminative power. Model evaluation results show that in the first stage of general AVP identification, the model achieved an accuracy of 0.9531 and an MCC of 0.9064, outperforming existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. In the second stage of functional subtype prediction, combined with a transfer learning strategy, the model realized accurate classification of 6 viral families and 8 specific viruses under small-sample conditions. AVP-Pro provides a powerful and interpretable new tool for the high-throughput screening of antiviral drugs. To further enhance accessibility for users, we have developed a user-friendly web interface, which is available at https://wwwy1031-avp-pro.hf.space.

Abstract: Quality of Service (QoS) prediction is one of the most fundamental problems in service computing and personalized recommendation. In the problem, there is a set of users and services, each associated with a set of descriptive features. Interactions between users and services produce feedback values, typically represented as numerical QoS metrics such as response time or availability. Given the observed feedback for a subset of user-service pairs, the goal is to predict the QoS values for the remaining pairs.
  A key challenge in QoS prediction is the inherent sparsity of user-service interactions, as only a small subset of feedback values is typically observed. To address this, we propose a self-augmented strategy that leverages a model's own predictions for iterative refinement. In particular, we partially mask the predicted values and feed them back into the model to predict again. Building on this idea, we design a self-augmented mixture-of-experts model, where multiple expert networks iteratively and collaboratively estimate QoS values. We find that the iterative augmentation process naturally aligns with the MoE architecture by enabling inter-expert communication: in the second round, each expert receives the first-round predictions and refines its output accordingly. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that our method outperforms existing baselines and achieves competitive results.

Abstract: Online financial services constitute an essential component of contemporary web ecosystems, yet their openness introduces substantial exposure to fraud that harms vulnerable users and weakens trust in digital finance. Such threats have become a significant web harm that erodes societal fairness and affects the well being of online communities. However, existing detection methods based on graph neural networks (GNNs) struggle with two persistent challenges: (1) fraud camouflage, where malicious transactions mimic benign behaviors to evade detection, and (2) long-tailed data distributions, which obscure rare but critical fraudulent cases. To fill these gaps, we propose HIMVH, a Hippocampus-Inspired Multi-View Hypergraph learning model for web finance fraud detection. Specifically, drawing inspiration from the scene conflict monitoring role of the hippocampus, we design a cross-view inconsistency perception module that captures subtle discrepancies and behavioral heterogeneity across multiple transaction views. This module enables the model to identify subtle cross-view conflicts for detecting online camouflaged fraudulent behaviors. Furthermore, inspired by the match-mismatch novelty detection mechanism of the CA1 region, we introduce a novelty-aware hypergraph learning module that measures feature deviations from neighborhood expectations and adaptively reweights messages, thereby enhancing sensitivity to online rare fraud patterns in the long-tailed settings. Extensive experiments on six web-based financial fraud datasets demonstrate that HIMVH achieves 6.42\% improvement in AUC, 9.74\% in F1 and 39.14\% in AP on average over 15 SOTA models.

Abstract: This paper proposes the soft Bayesian context tree model (Soft-BCT), which is a novel BCT model for real-valued time series. The Soft-BCT considers soft (probabilistic) splits of the context space, instead of hard (deterministic) splits of the context space as in the previous BCT for real-valued time series. A learning algorithm of the Soft-BCT is proposed based on the variational inference. For some real-world datasets, the Soft-BCT demonstrates almost the same or superior performance to the previous BCT.

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models on downstream tasks is crucial for realizing their cross-domain potential but often relies on sensitive data, raising privacy concerns. Differential privacy (DP) offers rigorous privacy guarantees and has been widely adopted in fine-tuning; however, naively injecting noise across the high-dimensional parameter space creates perturbations with large norms, degrading performance and destabilizing training. To address this issue, we propose DP-SFT, a two-stage subspace fine-tuning method that substantially reduces noise magnitude while preserving formal DP guarantees. Our intuition is that, during fine-tuning, significant parameter updates lie within a low-dimensional, task-specific subspace, while other directions change minimally. Hence, we only inject DP noise into this subspace to protect privacy without perturbing irrelevant parameters. In phase one, we identify the subspace by analyzing principal gradient directions to capture task-specific update signals. In phase two, we project full gradients onto this subspace, add DP noise, and map the perturbed gradients back to the original parameter space for model updates, markedly lowering noise impact. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that DP-SFT enhances accuracy and stability under rigorous DP constraints, accelerates convergence, and achieves substantial gains over DP fine-tuning baselines.

Abstract: Clustering is a fundamental tool that has garnered significant interest across a wide range of applications including text analysis. To improve clustering accuracy, many researchers have incorporated background knowledge, typically in the form of must-link and cannot-link constraints, to guide the clustering process. With the recent advent of large language models (LLMs), there is growing interest in improving clustering quality through LLM-based automatic constraint generation. In this paper, we propose a novel constraint-generation approach that reduces resource consumption by generating constraint sets rather than using traditional pairwise constraints. This approach improves both query efficiency and constraint accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods. We further introduce a constrained clustering algorithm tailored to the characteristics of LLM-generated constraints. Our method incorporates a confidence threshold and a penalty mechanism to address potentially inaccurate constraints. We evaluate our approach on five text datasets, considering both the cost of constraint generation and the overall clustering performance. The results show that our method achieves clustering accuracy comparable to the state-of-the-art algorithms while reducing the number of LLM queries by more than 20 times.

Abstract: Shape-morphing soft materials can enable diverse target morphologies through voxel-level material distribution design, offering significant potential for various applications. Despite progress in basic shape-morphing design with simple geometries, achieving advanced applications such as conformal implant deployment or aerodynamic morphing requires accurate and diverse morphing designs on complex geometries, which remains challenging. Here, we present a Spectral and Spatial Neural Operator (S2NO), which enables high-fidelity morphing prediction on complex geometries. S2NO effectively captures global and local morphing behaviours on irregular computational domains by integrating Laplacian eigenfunction encoding and spatial convolutions. Combining S2NO with evolutionary algorithms enables voxel-level optimisation of material distributions for shape morphing programming on various complex geometries, including irregular-boundary shapes, porous structures, and thin-walled structures. Furthermore, the neural operator's discretisation-invariant property enables super-resolution material distribution design, further expanding the diversity and complexity of morphing design. These advancements significantly improve the efficiency and capability of programming complex shape morphing.

Abstract: Credit risk models are a critical decision-support tool for financial institutions, yet tightening data-protection rules (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) increasingly prohibit cross-border sharing of borrower data, even as these models benefit from cross-institution learning. Traditional default prediction suffers from two limitations: binary classification ignores default timing, treating early defaulters (high loss) equivalently to late defaulters (low loss), and centralized training violates emerging regulatory constraints. We propose a Federated Survival Learning framework with Bayesian Differential Privacy (FSL-BDP) that models time-to-default trajectories without centralizing sensitive data. The framework provides Bayesian (data-dependent) differential privacy (DP) guarantees while enabling institutions to jointly learn risk dynamics. Experiments on three real-world credit datasets (LendingClub, SBA, Bondora) show that federation fundamentally alters the relative effectiveness of privacy mechanisms. While classical DP performs better than Bayesian DP in centralized settings, the latter benefits substantially more from federation (+7.0\% vs +1.4\%), achieving near parity of non-private performance and outperforming classical DP in the majority of participating clients. This ranking reversal yields a key decision-support insight: privacy mechanism selection should be evaluated in the target deployment architecture, rather than centralized benchmarks. These findings provide actionable guidance for practitioners designing privacy-preserving decision support systems in regulated, multi-institutional environments.

Abstract: Molecular property prediction is becoming one of the major applications of graph learning in Web-based services, e.g., online protein structure prediction and drug discovery. A key challenge arises in few-shot scenarios, where only a few labeled molecules are available for predicting unseen properties. Recently, several studies have used in-context learning to capture relationships among molecules and properties, but they face two limitations in: (1) exploiting prior knowledge of functional groups that are causally linked to properties and (2) identifying key substructures directly correlated with properties. We propose CaMol, a context-aware graph causality inference framework, to address these challenges by using a causal inference perspective, assuming that each molecule consists of a latent causal structure that determines a specific property. First, we introduce a context graph that encodes chemical knowledge by linking functional groups, molecules, and properties to guide the discovery of causal substructures. Second, we propose a learnable atom masking strategy to disentangle causal substructures from confounding ones. Third, we introduce a distribution intervener that applies backdoor adjustment by combining causal substructures with chemically grounded confounders, disentangling causal effects from real-world chemical variations. Experiments on diverse molecular datasets showed that CaMol achieved superior accuracy and sample efficiency in few-shot tasks, showing its generalizability to unseen properties. Also, the discovered causal substructures were strongly aligned with chemical knowledge about functional groups, supporting the model interpretability.

Abstract: Unplanned engine failures in helicopters can lead to severe operational disruptions, safety hazards, and costly repairs. To mitigate these risks, this study compares two predictive maintenance strategies for helicopter engines: a supervised classification pipeline and an unsupervised anomaly detection approach based on autoencoders (AEs). The supervised method relies on labelled examples of both normal and faulty behaviour, while the unsupervised approach learns a model of normal operation using only healthy engine data, flagging deviations as potential faults. Both methods are evaluated on a real-world dataset comprising labelled snapshots of helicopter engine telemetry. While supervised models demonstrate strong performance when annotated failures are available, the AE achieves effective detection without requiring fault labels, making it particularly well suited for settings where failure data are scarce or incomplete. The comparison highlights the practical trade-offs between accuracy, data availability, and deployment feasibility, and underscores the potential of unsupervised learning as a viable solution for early fault detection in aerospace applications.

Abstract: The computation of resistance distance is pivotal in a wide range of graph analysis applications, including graph clustering, link prediction, and graph neural networks. Despite its foundational importance, efficient algorithms for computing resistance distances on large graphs are still lacking. Existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, including power iteration-based algorithms and random walk-based local approaches, often struggle with slow convergence rates, particularly when the condition number of the graph Laplacian matrix, denoted by $κ$, is large. To tackle this challenge, we propose two novel and efficient algorithms inspired by the classic Lanczos method: Lanczos Iteration and Lanczos Push, both designed to reduce dependence on $κ$. Among them, Lanczos Iteration is a near-linear time global algorithm, whereas Lanczos Push is a local algorithm with a time complexity independent of the size of the graph. More specifically, we prove that the time complexity of Lanczos Iteration is $\tilde{O}(\sqrtκ m)$ ($m$ is the number of edges of the graph and $\tilde{O}$ means the complexity omitting the $\log$ terms) which achieves a speedup of $\sqrtκ$ compared to previous power iteration-based global methods. For Lanczos Push, we demonstrate that its time complexity is $\tilde{O}(κ^{2.75})$ under certain mild and frequently established assumptions, which represents a significant improvement of $κ^{0.25}$ over the SOTA random walk-based local algorithms. We validate our algorithms through extensive experiments on eight real-world datasets of varying sizes and statistical properties, demonstrating that Lanczos Iteration and Lanczos Push significantly outperform SOTA methods in terms of both efficiency and accuracy.

Abstract: How to find a natural grouping of a large real data set? Clustering requires a balance between abstraction and representation. To identify clusters, we need to abstract from superfluous details of individual objects. But we also need a rich representation that emphasizes the key features shared by groups of objects that distinguish them from other groups of objects.
  Each clustering algorithm implements a different trade-off between abstraction and representation. Classical K-means implements a high level of abstraction - details are simply averaged out - combined with a very simple representation - all clusters are Gaussians in the original data space. We will see how approaches to subspace and deep clustering support high-dimensional and complex data by allowing richer representations. However, with increasing representational expressiveness comes the need to explicitly enforce abstraction in the objective function to ensure that the resulting method performs clustering and not just representation learning. We will see how current deep clustering methods define and enforce abstraction through centroid-based and density-based clustering losses. Balancing the conflicting goals of abstraction and representation is challenging. Ideas from subspace clustering help by learning one latent space for the information that is relevant to clustering and another latent space to capture all other information in the data.
  The tutorial ends with an outlook on future research in clustering. Future methods will more adaptively balance abstraction and representation to improve performance, energy efficiency and interpretability. By automatically finding the sweet spot between abstraction and representation, the human brain is very good at clustering and other related tasks such as single-shot learning. So, there is still much room for improvement.

Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation tackles the problem that domain shifts between training and test data impair the performance of neural networks in many real-world applications. Thereby, in realistic scenarios, the source data may no longer be available during adaptation, and the label space of the target domain may differ from the source label space. This setting, known as source-free universal domain adaptation (SF-UniDA), has recently gained attention, but all existing approaches only assume a single domain shift from source to target. In this work, we present the first study on continual SF-UniDA, where the model must adapt sequentially to a stream of multiple different unlabeled target domains. Building upon our previous methods for online SF-UniDA, we combine their key ideas by integrating Gaussian mixture model-based pseudo-labeling within a mean teacher framework for improved stability over long adaptation sequences. Additionally, we introduce consistency losses for further robustness. The resulting method GMM-COMET provides a strong first baseline for continual SF-UniDA and is the only approach in our experiments to consistently improve upon the source-only model across all evaluated scenarios. Our code is available at https://github.com/pascalschlachter/GMM-COMET.

Abstract: Unplanned failures in industrial hydraulic pumps can halt production and incur substantial costs. We explore two unsupervised autoencoder (AE) schemes for early fault detection: a feed-forward model that analyses individual sensor snapshots and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model that captures short temporal windows. Both networks are trained only on healthy data drawn from a minute-level log of 52 sensor channels; evaluation uses a separate set that contains seven annotated fault intervals. Despite the absence of fault samples during training, the models achieve high reliability.

Abstract: Generative modeling offers a promising solution to data scarcity and privacy challenges in time series analysis. However, the structural complexity of time series, characterized by multi-scale temporal patterns and heterogeneous components, remains insufficiently addressed. In this work, we propose a structure-disentangled multiscale generation framework for time series. Our approach encodes sequences into discrete tokens at multiple temporal resolutions and performs autoregressive generation in a coarse-to-fine manner, thereby preserving hierarchical dependencies. To tackle structural heterogeneity, we introduce a dual-path VQ-VAE that disentangles trend and seasonal components, enabling the learning of semantically consistent latent representations. Additionally, we present a guidance-based reconstruction strategy, where coarse seasonal signals are utilized as priors to guide the reconstruction of fine-grained seasonal patterns. Experiments on six datasets show that our approach produces higher-quality time series than existing methods. Notably, our model achieves strong performance with a significantly reduced parameter count and exhibits superior capability in generating high-quality long-term sequences. Our implementation is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/TimeMAR-BC5B.

Abstract: Although post-training quantization (PTQ) provides an efficient numerical compression scheme for deploying large language models (LLMs) on resource-constrained devices, the representativeness and universality of calibration data remain a core bottleneck in determining the accuracy of quantization parameters. Traditional PTQ methods typically rely on limited samples, making it difficult to capture the activation distribution during the inference phase, leading to biases in quantization parameters. To address this, we propose \textbf{FAQ} (Family-Aware Quantization), a calibration data regeneration framework that leverages prior knowledge from LLMs of the same family to generate high-fidelity calibration samples. Specifically, FAQ first inputs the original calibration samples into a larger LLM from the same family as the target model, regenerating a series of high-fidelity calibration data using a highly consistent knowledge system. Subsequently, this data, carrying Chain-of-Thought reasoning and conforming to the expected activation distribution, undergoes group competition under expert guidance to select the best samples, which are then re-normalized to enhance the effectiveness of standard PTQ. Experiments on multiple model series, including Qwen3-8B, show that FAQ reduces accuracy loss by up to 28.5\% compared to the baseline with original calibration data, demonstrating its powerful potential and contribution.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) for large language models (LLMs) has attracted increasing attention as a way to enable privacy-preserving adaptation over distributed data. Parameter-efficient methods such as LoRA are widely adopted to reduce communication and memory costs. Despite these advances, practical FL deployments often exhibit rank heterogeneity, since different clients may use different low-rank configurations. This makes direct aggregation of LoRA updates biased and unstable. Existing solutions typically enforce unified ranks or align heterogeneous updates into a shared subspace, which over-constrains client-specific semantics, limits personalization, and provides weak protection of local client information under differential privacy noise. To address this issue, we propose Selective Dual-module Federated LoRA (SDFLoRA), which decomposes each client adapter into a global module that captures transferable knowledge and a local module that preserves client-specific adaptations. The global module is selectively aligned and aggregated across clients, while local modules remain private. This design enables robust learning under rank heterogeneity and supports privacy-aware optimization by injecting differential privacy noise exclusively into the global module. Experiments on GLUE benchmarks demonstrate that SDFLoRA outperforms representative federated LoRA baselines and achieves a better utility-privacy trade-off.

Abstract: For linear partial differential equations with known fundamental solutions, this work introduces a novel operator learning framework that relies exclusively on domain boundary data, including solution values and normal derivatives, rather than full-domain sampling. By integrating the previously developed Mathematical Artificial Data (MAD) method, which enforces physical consistency, all training data are synthesized directly from the fundamental solutions of the target problems, resulting in a fully data-driven pipeline without the need for external measurements or numerical simulations. We refer to this approach as the Mathematical Artificial Data Boundary Neural Operator (MAD-BNO), which learns boundary-to-boundary mappings using MAD-generated Dirichlet-Neumann data pairs. Once trained, the interior solution at arbitrary locations can be efficiently recovered through boundary integral formulations, supporting Dirichlet, Neumann, and mixed boundary conditions as well as general source terms. The proposed method is validated on benchmark operator learning tasks for two-dimensional Laplace, Poisson, and Helmholtz equations, where it achieves accuracy comparable to or better than existing neural operator approaches while significantly reducing training time. The framework is naturally extensible to three-dimensional problems and complex geometries.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face the "knowledge cutoff" challenge, where their frozen parametric memory prevents direct internalization of new information. While Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) is commonly used to update model knowledge, it often updates factual content without reliably improving the model's ability to use the newly incorporated information for question answering or decision-making. Reinforcement Learning (RL) is essential for acquiring reasoning skills; however, its high computational cost makes it impractical for efficient online adaptation. We empirically observe that the parameter updates induced by SFT and RL are nearly orthogonal. Based on this observation, we propose Parametric Skill Transfer (PaST), a framework that supports modular skill transfer for efficient and effective knowledge adaptation. By extracting a domain-agnostic Skill Vector from a source domain, we can linearly inject knowledge manipulation skills into a target model after it has undergone lightweight SFT on new data. Experiments on knowledge-incorporation QA (SQuAD, LooGLE) and agentic tool-use benchmarks (ToolBench) demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. On SQuAD, PaST outperforms the state-of-the-art self-editing SFT baseline by up to 9.9 points. PaST further scales to long-context QA on LooGLE with an 8.0-point absolute accuracy gain, and improves zero-shot ToolBench success rates by +10.3 points on average with consistent gains across tool categories, indicating strong scalability and cross-domain transferability of the Skill Vector.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are emerging as powerful tools for nonlinear Model Order Reduction (MOR) of time-dependent parameterized Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). However, existing methodologies struggle to combine geometric inductive biases with interpretable latent behavior, overlooking dynamics-driven features or disregarding spatial information. In this work, we address this gap by introducing Latent Dynamics Graph Convolutional Network (LD-GCN), a purely data-driven, encoder-free architecture that learns a global, low-dimensional representation of dynamical systems conditioned on external inputs and parameters. The temporal evolution is modeled in the latent space and advanced through time-stepping, allowing for time-extrapolation, and the trajectories are consistently decoded onto geometrically parameterized domains using a GNN. Our framework enhances interpretability by enabling the analysis of the reduced dynamics and supporting zero-shot prediction through latent interpolation. The methodology is mathematically validated via a universal approximation theorem for encoder-free architectures, and numerically tested on complex computational mechanics problems involving physical and geometric parameters, including the detection of bifurcating phenomena for Navier-Stokes equations.

Abstract: Boosting is a powerful method that turns weak learners, which perform only slightly better than random guessing, into strong learners with high accuracy. While boosting is well understood in the classic setting, it is less so in the agnostic case, where no assumptions are made about the data. Indeed, only recently was the sample complexity of agnostic boosting nearly settled arXiv:2503.09384, but the known algorithm achieving this bound has exponential running time. In this work, we propose the first agnostic boosting algorithm with near-optimal sample complexity, running in time polynomial in the sample size when considering the other parameters of the problem fixed.

Abstract: Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a prevalent neurodevelopmental disorder with limited objective diagnostic tools, highlighting the urgent need for objective, biology-based diagnostic frameworks in precision psychiatry. We integrate urinary metabolomics with an interpretable machine learning framework to identify biochemical signatures associated with ADHD. Targeted metabolomic profiles from 52 ADHD and 46 control participants were analyzed using a Closest Resemblance (CR) classifier with embedded feature selection. The CR model outperformed Random Forest and K-Nearest Neighbor classifiers, achieving an AUC > 0.97 based on a reduced panel of 14 metabolites. These metabolites including dopamine 4-sulfate, N-acetylaspartylglutamic acid, and citrulline map to dopaminergic neurotransmission and amino acid metabolism pathways, offering mechanistic insight into ADHD pathophysiology. The CR classifier's transparent decision boundaries and low computational cost support integration into targeted metabolomic assays and future point of care diagnostic platforms. Overall, this work demonstrates a translational framework combining metabolomics and interpretable machine learning to advance objective, biologically informed diagnostic strategies for ADHD.

Abstract: Tabular data high-stakes critical decision-making in domains such as finance, healthcare, and scientific discovery. Yet, learning effectively from tabular data in few-shot settings, where labeled examples are scarce, remains a fundamental challenge. Traditional tree-based methods often falter in these regimes due to their reliance on statistical purity metrics, which become unstable and prone to overfitting with limited supervision. At the same time, direct applications of large language models (LLMs) often overlook its inherent structure, leading to suboptimal performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose FORESTLLM, a novel framework that unifies the structural inductive biases of decision forests with the semantic reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Crucially, FORESTLLM leverages the LLM only during training, treating it as an offline model designer that encodes rich, contextual knowledge into a lightweight, interpretable forest model, eliminating the need for LLM inference at test time. Our method is two-fold. First, we introduce a semantic splitting criterion in which the LLM evaluates candidate partitions based on their coherence over both labeled and unlabeled data, enabling the induction of more robust and generalizable tree structures under few-shot supervision. Second, we propose a one-time in-context inference mechanism for leaf node stabilization, where the LLM distills the decision path and its supporting examples into a concise, deterministic prediction, replacing noisy empirical estimates with semantically informed outputs. Across a diverse suite of few-shot classification and regression benchmarks, FORESTLLM achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable capabilities in natural language processing tasks. However, the potential of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which shows great successes for enhancing large language models (LLMs), has not been well explored, due to the fundamental difference between LLM and DLM decoding. To fill this critical gap, we systematically test the performance of DLMs within the RAG framework. Our findings reveal that DLMs coupled with RAG show promising potentials with stronger dependency on contextual information, but suffer from limited generation precision. We identify a key underlying issue: Response Semantic Drift (RSD), where the generated answer progressively deviates from the query's original semantics, leading to low precision content. We trace this problem to the denoising strategies in DLMs, which fail to maintain semantic alignment with the query throughout the iterative denoising process. To address this, we propose Semantic-Preserving REtrieval-Augmented Diffusion (SPREAD), a novel framework that introduces a query-relevance-guided denoising strategy. By actively guiding the denoising trajectory, SPREAD ensures the generation remains anchored to the query's semantics and effectively suppresses drift. Experimental results demonstrate that SPREAD significantly enhances the precision and effectively mitigates RSD of generated answers within the RAG framework.

Abstract: Time-series forecasting is fundamental in industrial domains like manufacturing and smart factories. As systems evolve toward automation, models must operate on edge devices (e.g., PLCs, microcontrollers) with strict constraints on latency and memory, limiting parameters to a few thousand. Conventional deep architectures are often impractical here. We propose the Fourier-Efficient Adaptive Temporal Hierarchy Forecaster (FEATHer) for accurate long-term forecasting under severe limits. FEATHer introduces: (i) ultra-lightweight multiscale decomposition into frequency pathways; (ii) a shared Dense Temporal Kernel using projection-depthwise convolution-projection without recurrence or attention; (iii) frequency-aware branch gating that adaptively fuses representations based on spectral characteristics; and (iv) a Sparse Period Kernel reconstructing outputs via period-wise downsampling to capture seasonality. FEATHer maintains a compact architecture (as few as 400 parameters) while outperforming baselines. Across eight benchmarks, it achieves the best ranking, recording 60 first-place results with an average rank of 2.05. These results demonstrate that reliable long-range forecasting is achievable on constrained edge hardware, offering a practical direction for industrial real-time inference.

Abstract: Energy efficiency has become an integral aspect of modern computing infrastructure design, impacting the performance, cost, scalability, and durability of production systems. The incorporation of power actuation and sensing capabilities in CPU designs is indicative of this, enabling the deployment of system software that can actively monitor and adjust energy consumption and performance at runtime. While reinforcement learning (RL) would seem ideal for the design of such energy efficiency control systems, online training presents challenges ranging from the lack of proper models for setting up an adequate simulated environment, to perturbation (noise) and reliability issues, if training is deployed on a live system.
  In this paper we discuss the use of offline reinforcement learning as an alternative approach for the design of an autonomous CPU power controller, with the goal of improving the energy efficiency of parallel applications at runtime without unduly impacting their performance. Offline RL sidesteps the issues incurred by online RL training by leveraging a dataset of state transitions collected from arbitrary policies prior to training.
  Our methodology applies offline RL to a gray-box approach to energy efficiency, combining online application-agnostic performance data (e.g., heartbeats) and hardware performance counters to ensure that the scientific objectives are met with limited performance degradation. Evaluating our method on a variety of compute-bound and memory-bound benchmarks and controlling power on a live system through Intel's Running Average Power Limit, we demonstrate that such an offline-trained agent can substantially reduce energy consumption at a tolerable performance degradation cost.

Abstract: This work describes a novel data-driven latent space inference framework built on paired autoencoders to handle observational inconsistencies when solving inverse problems. Our approach uses two autoencoders, one for the parameter space and one for the observation space, connected by learned mappings between the autoencoders' latent spaces. These mappings enable a surrogate for regularized inversion and optimization in low-dimensional, informative latent spaces. Our flexible framework can work with partial, noisy, or out-of-distribution data, all while maintaining consistency with the underlying physical models. The paired autoencoders enable reconstruction of corrupted data, and then use the reconstructed data for parameter estimation, which produces more accurate reconstructions compared to paired autoencoders alone and end-to-end encoder-decoders of the same architecture, especially in scenarios with data inconsistencies. We demonstrate our approaches on two imaging examples in medical tomography and geophysical seismic-waveform inversion, but the described approaches are broadly applicable to a variety of inverse problems in scientific and engineering applications.

Abstract: Credit assignment is a core challenge in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), especially in large-scale systems with structured, local interactions. Graph-based Markov decision processes (GMDPs) capture such settings via an influence graph, but standard critics are poorly aligned with this structure: global value functions provide weak per-agent learning signals, while existing local constructions can be difficult to estimate and ill-behaved in infinite-horizon settings. We introduce the Diffusion Value Function (DVF), a factored value function for GMDPs that assigns to each agent a value component by diffusing rewards over the influence graph with temporal discounting and spatial attenuation. We show that DVF is well-defined, admits a Bellman fixed point, and decomposes the global discounted value via an averaging property. DVF can be used as a drop-in critic in standard RL algorithms and estimated scalably with graph neural networks. Building on DVF, we propose Diffusion A2C (DA2C) and a sparse message-passing actor, Learned DropEdge GNN (LD-GNN), for learning decentralised algorithms under communication costs. Across the firefighting benchmark and three distributed computation tasks (vector graph colouring and two transmit power optimisation problems), DA2C consistently outperforms local and global critic baselines, improving average reward by up to 11%.

Abstract: Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) have shown strong performance in learning solution maps of partial differential equations (PDEs), but their robustness under distribution shifts, long-horizon rollouts, and structural perturbations remains poorly understood. We present a systematic stress-testing framework that probes failure modes of FNOs across five qualitatively different PDE families: dispersive, elliptic, multi-scale fluid, financial, and chaotic systems. Rather than optimizing in-distribution accuracy, we design controlled stress tests--including parameter shifts, boundary or terminal condition changes, resolution extrapolation with spectral analysis, and iterative rollouts--to expose vulnerabilities such as spectral bias, compounding integration errors, and overfitting to restricted boundary regimes. Our large-scale evaluation (1{,}000 trained models) reveals that distribution shifts in parameters or boundary conditions can inflate errors by more than an order of magnitude, while resolution changes primarily concentrate error in high-frequency modes. Input perturbations generally do not amplify error, though worst-case scenarios (e.g., localized Poisson perturbations) remain challenging. These findings provide a comparative failure-mode atlas and actionable insights for improving robustness in operator learning.

Abstract: Deep Differentiable Logic Gate Networks (LGNs) and Lookup Table Networks (LUTNs) are demonstrated to be suitable for the automatic classification of electrocardiograms (ECGs) using the inter-patient paradigm. The methods are benchmarked using the MIT-BIH arrhythmia data set, achieving up to 94.28% accuracy and a $jκ$ index of 0.683 on a four-class classification problem. Our models use between 2.89k and 6.17k FLOPs, including preprocessing and readout, which is three to six orders of magnitude less compared to SOTA methods. A novel preprocessing method is utilized that attains superior performance compared to existing methods for both the mixed-patient and inter-patient paradigms. In addition, a novel method for training the Lookup Tables (LUTs) in LUTNs is devised that uses the Boolean equation of a multiplexer (MUX). Additionally, rate coding was utilized for the first time in these LGNs and LUTNs, enhancing the performance of LGNs. Furthermore, it is the first time that LGNs and LUTNs have been benchmarked on the MIT-BIH arrhythmia dataset using the inter-patient paradigm. Using an Artix 7 FPGA, between 2000 and 2990 LUTs were needed, and between 5 to 7 mW (i.e. 50 pJ to 70 pJ per inference) was estimated for running these models. The performance in terms of both accuracy and $jκ$-index is significantly higher compared to previous LGN results. These positive results suggest that one can utilize LGNs and LUTNs for the detection of arrhythmias at extremely low power and high speeds in heart implants or wearable devices, even for patients not included in the training set.

Abstract: Urban wind flow reconstruction is essential for assessing air quality, heat dispersion, and pedestrian comfort, yet remains challenging when only sparse sensor data are available. We propose GenDA, a generative data assimilation framework that reconstructs high-resolution wind fields on unstructured meshes from limited observations. The model employs a multiscale graph-based diffusion architecture trained on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations and interprets classifier-free guidance as a learned posterior reconstruction mechanism: the unconditional branch learns a geometry-aware flow prior, while the sensor-conditioned branch injects observational constraints during sampling. This formulation enables obstacle-aware reconstruction and generalization across unseen geometries, wind directions, and mesh resolutions without retraining. We consider both sparse fixed sensors and trajectory-based observations using the same reconstruction procedure. When evaluated against supervised graph neural network (GNN) baselines and classical reduced-order data assimilation methods, GenDA reduces the relative root-mean-square error (RRMSE) by 25-57% and increases the structural similarity index (SSIM) by 23-33% across the tested meshes. Experiments are conducted on Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) simulations of a real urban neighbourhood in Bristol, United Kingdom, at a characteristic Reynolds number of $\mathrm{Re}\approx2\times10^{7}$, featuring complex building geometry and irregular terrain. The proposed framework provides a scalable path toward generative, geometry-aware data assimilation for environmental monitoring in complex domains.

Abstract: Diffusion models now generate high-quality, diverse samples, with an increasing focus on more powerful models. Although ensembling is a well-known way to improve supervised models, its application to unconditional score-based diffusion models remains largely unexplored. In this work we investigate whether it provides tangible benefits for generative modelling. We find that while ensembling the scores generally improves the score-matching loss and model likelihood, it fails to consistently enhance perceptual quality metrics such as FID on image datasets. We confirm this observation across a breadth of aggregation rules using Deep Ensembles, Monte Carlo Dropout, on CIFAR-10 and FFHQ. We attempt to explain this discrepancy by investigating possible explanations, such as the link between score estimation and image quality. We also look into tabular data through random forests, and find that one aggregation strategy outperforms the others. Finally, we provide theoretical insights into the summing of score models, which shed light not only on ensembling but also on several model composition techniques (e.g. guidance).

Abstract: Transformer pretraining is increasingly constrained by memory and compute requirements, with the key-value (KV) cache emerging as a dominant bottleneck during training and autoregressive decoding. We propose \textit{low-rank KV adaptation} (LRKV), a simple modification of multi-head attention that reduces KV cache memory by exploiting redundancy across attention heads while preserving full token-level resolution. Each layer uses a shared full-rank KV projection augmented with low-rank, head-specific residuals, yielding a continuous trade-off between complete sharing and fully independent attention.
  LRKV is a drop-in replacement for standard multi-head attention and directly subsumes query-sharing approaches such as multi-query and grouped-query attention, while remaining distinct from latent-compression methods such as multi-latent attention (MLA). Across large-scale pretraining experiments, LRKV consistently achieves faster loss reduction, lower validation perplexity, and stronger downstream task performance than standard attention, MQA/GQA, and MLA. At the 2.5B scale, LRKV outperforms standard attention while using roughly half the KV cache, and reaches equivalent model quality with up to \textbf{20-25\% less training compute} when measured in cumulative FLOPs. To explain these gains, we analyze attention head structure in operator space and show that LRKV preserves nearly all functional head diversity relative to standard attention, whereas more aggressive KV-sharing mechanisms rely on compensatory query specialization. Together, these results establish LRKV as a practical and effective attention mechanism for scaling Transformer pretraining under memory- and compute-constrained regimes.

Abstract: Extractive summarization (ES) aims to generate a concise summary by selecting a subset of sentences from a document while maximizing relevance and minimizing redundancy. Although modern ES systems achieve high accuracy using powerful neural models, their deployment typically relies on CPU or GPU infrastructures that are energy-intensive and poorly suited for real-time inference in resource-constrained environments. In this work, we explore the feasibility of implementing McDonald-style extractive summarization on a low-power CMOS coupled oscillator-based Ising machine (COBI) that supports integer-valued, all-to-all spin couplings. We first propose a hardware-aware Ising formulation that reduces the scale imbalance between local fields and coupling terms, thereby improving robustness to coefficient quantization: this method can be applied to any problem formulation that requires k of n variables to be chosen. We then develop a complete ES pipeline including (i) stochastic rounding and iterative refinement to compensate for precision loss, and (ii) a decomposition strategy that partitions a large ES problem into smaller Ising subproblems that can be efficiently solved on COBI and later combined. Experimental results on the CNN/DailyMail dataset show that our pipeline can produce high-quality summaries using only integer-coupled Ising hardware with limited precision. COBI achieves 3-4.5x runtime speedups compared to a brute-force method, which is comparable to software Tabu search, and two to three orders of magnitude reductions in energy, while maintaining competitive summary quality. These results highlight the potential of deploying CMOS Ising solvers for real-time, low-energy text summarization on edge devices.

Abstract: Smart grid infrastructures have revolutionized energy distribution, but their day-to-day operations require robust anomaly detection methods to counter risks associated with cyber-physical threats and system faults potentially caused by natural disasters, equipment malfunctions, and cyber attacks. Conventional machine learning (ML) models are effective in several domains, yet they struggle to represent the complexities observed in smart grid systems. Furthermore, traditional ML models are highly susceptible to adversarial manipulations, making them increasingly unreliable for real-world deployment. Quantum ML (QML) provides a unique advantage, utilizing quantum-enhanced feature representations to model the intricacies of the high-dimensional nature of smart grid systems while demonstrating greater resilience to adversarial manipulation. In this work, we propose QUPID, a partitioned quantum neural network (PQNN) that outperforms traditional state-of-the-art ML models in anomaly detection. We extend our model to R-QUPID that even maintains its performance when including differential privacy (DP) for enhanced robustness. Moreover, our partitioning framework addresses a significant scalability problem in QML by efficiently distributing computational workloads, making quantum-enhanced anomaly detection practical in large-scale smart grid environments. Our experimental results across various scenarios exemplifies the efficacy of QUPID and R-QUPID to significantly improve anomaly detection capabilities and robustness compared to traditional ML approaches.

Abstract: Progress in Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) algorithm development is limited by the fragmentation and lack of standardization across existing T1D management datasets. Current datasets differ substantially in structure and are time-consuming to access and process, which impedes data integration and reduces the comparability and generalizability of algorithmic developments. This work aims to establish a unified and accessible data resource for T1D algorithm development. Multiple publicly available T1D datasets were consolidated into a unified resource, termed the MetaboNet dataset. Inclusion required the availability of both continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data and corresponding insulin pump dosing records. Additionally, auxiliary information such as reported carbohydrate intake and physical activity was retained when present. The MetaboNet dataset comprises 3135 subjects and 1228 patient-years of overlapping CGM and insulin data, making it substantially larger than existing standalone benchmark datasets. The resource is distributed as a fully public subset available for immediate download at https://metabo-net.org/ , and with a Data Use Agreement (DUA)-restricted subset accessible through their respective application processes. For the datasets in the latter subset, processing pipelines are provided to automatically convert the data into the standardized MetaboNet format. A consolidated public dataset for T1D research is presented, and the access pathways for both its unrestricted and DUA-governed components are described. The resulting dataset covers a broad range of glycemic profiles and demographics and thus can yield more generalizable algorithmic performance than individual datasets.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Frontier language model capabilities are improving rapidly. We thus need stronger mitigations against bad actors misusing increasingly powerful systems. Prior work has shown that activation probes may be a promising misuse mitigation technique, but we identify a key remaining challenge: probes fail to generalize under important production distribution shifts. In particular, we find that the shift from short-context to long-context inputs is difficult for existing probe architectures. We propose several new probe architecture that handle this long-context distribution shift.
  We evaluate these probes in the cyber-offensive domain, testing their robustness against various production-relevant shifts, including multi-turn conversations, static jailbreaks, and adaptive red teaming. Our results demonstrate that while multimax addresses context length, a combination of architecture choice and training on diverse distributions is required for broad generalization. Additionally, we show that pairing probes with prompted classifiers achieves optimal accuracy at a low cost due to the computational efficiency of probes.
  These findings have informed the successful deployment of misuse mitigation probes in user-facing instances of Gemini, Google's frontier language model. Finally, we find early positive results using AlphaEvolve to automate improvements in both probe architecture search and adaptive red teaming, showing that automating some AI safety research is already possible.
