Abstract: We embed buying rights into a (repeated) Arrow-Debreu model to study the
long-term effects of regulation through buying rights on arising inequality.
Our motivation stems from situations that typically call for regulatory
interventions, such as rationing, namely, distribution crises in which demand
and supply are persistently misaligned. In such settings, scarce resources tend
to become increasingly concentrated among more affluent individuals, while the
needs of the broader population remain unmet. While fully centralized
distribution may be logistically or politically unfeasible, issuing buying
rights offers a more practical alternative: they can be implemented digitally,
e.g., via tokens traded on online platforms, making them significantly easier
to administer. We model a scenario in which a regulator periodically
distributes buying rights with the aim of promoting a more equitable
allocation. Our contributions include (i) the definition of the (iterated)
market where in each round the buying rights are distributed and then traded
alongside the resource, (ii) the approximation algorithm of the market-clearing
prices in every round, and (iii) the upper bound on \textit{frustration} -- a
notion conceptually similar to the Price of Anarchy, but for systems regulated
through buying rights, defined as the arising loss in fairness the individual
buyers have to take when the distribution is handled via the market.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Predatory pricing -- where a firm strategically lowers prices to undermine
competitors -- is a contentious topic in dynamic oligopoly theory, with
scholars debating practical relevance and the existence of predatory
equilibria. Although finite-horizon dynamic models have long been proposed to
capture the strategic intertemporal incentives of oligopolists, the existence
and form of equilibrium strategies in settings that allow for firm exit
(drop-outs following loss-making periods) have remained an open question. We
focus on the seminal dynamic oligopoly model by Selten (1965) that introduces
the subgame perfect equilibrium and analyzes smooth market sharing. Equilibrium
can be derived analytically in models that do not allow for dropouts, but not
in models that can lead to predatory pricing. In this paper, we leverage recent
advances in deep reinforcement learning to compute and verify equilibria in
finite-horizon dynamic oligopoly games. Our experiments reveal two key
findings: first, state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning algorithms
reliably converge to equilibrium in both perfect- and imperfect-information
oligopoly models; second, when firms face asymmetric cost structures, the
resulting equilibria exhibit predatory pricing behavior. These results
demonstrate that predatory pricing can emerge as a rational equilibrium
strategy across a broad variety of model settings. By providing equilibrium
analysis of finite-horizon dynamic oligopoly models with drop-outs, our study
answers a decade-old question and offers new insights for competition
authorities and regulators.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The exceptional potential of large language models (LLMs) in handling text
information has garnered significant attention in the field of financial
trading. However, current trading agents primarily focus on single-step trading
tasks and lack awareness of continuous position management. Therefore, we
propose a position-aware trading task designed to simulate a more realistic
market. To address this task, we develop a trading agent system, FinPos,
optimized for position management. FinPos is able to interpret various types of
market information from a professional perspective, providing a reliable basis
for positioning decisions. To mitigate the substantial market risks arising
from position fluctuations, FinPos employs dual decision agents. Furthermore,
the continuous nature of position management necessitates our adoption of
multi-timescale rewards, which in turn empowers FinPos to effectively balance
short-term fluctuations against long-term trends. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that FinPos surpasses state-of-the-art trading agents in the
position-aware trading task, which closely mirrors real market conditions. More
importantly, our findings reveal that LLM-centered agent systems exhibit a
vast, largely unexplored potential in long-term market decision-making.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: AI deployment increasingly resembles a pipeline of data transformation,
fine-tuning, and agent interactions rather than a monolithic LLM job; recent
examples include RLHF/RLAIF training and agentic workflows. To cope with this
shift, we propose FlowMesh, a multi-tenant service fabric that executes and
optimizes these workloads as one shared service instead of isolated pipelines.
It decomposes workflows into fine-grained operators with recorded lineage,
enabling de-duplication of work across users and batching requests on the same
hardware while preserving per-workflow provenance. A global control plane
maintains a cluster-wide pool of ready operators and uses a single utility
function to pick both the batch and the worker, balancing throughput, cost, and
data locality on heterogeneous GPUs. The data plane is an elastic fleet of
stateless workers backed by a content-addressable store, enabling rapid,
automatic scale-out, safe retry after preemption, and portability across
managed clusters such as Kubernetes and geo-distributed GPU marketplaces such
as Vast.ai. Compared with baseline solutions, FlowMesh achieves up to 3.8x cost
reduction and 2.0x lower energy usage, provides a similar or better latency
profile, and remains efficient under dynamic and failure-prone conditions.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Accurate traffic flow forecasting is essential for the development of
intelligent transportation systems (ITS), supporting tasks such as traffic
signal optimization, congestion management, and route planning. Traditional
models often fail to effectively capture complex spatial-temporal dependencies
in large-scale road networks, especially under the influence of external
factors such as weather, holidays, and traffic accidents. To address this
challenge, this paper proposes a cloud-based hybrid model that integrates
Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (ST-GNN) with a Transformer architecture
for traffic flow prediction. The model leverages the strengths of GNNs in
modeling spatial correlations across road networks and the Transformers'
ability to capture long-term temporal dependencies. External contextual
features are incorporated via feature fusion to enhance predictive accuracy.
The proposed model is deployed on a cloud computing platform to achieve
scalability and real-time adaptability. Experimental evaluation of the dataset
shows that our model outperforms baseline methods (LSTM, TCN, GCN, pure
Transformer) with an RMSE of only 17.92 and a MAE of only 10.53. These findings
suggest that the hybrid GNN-Transformer approach provides an effective and
scalable solution for cloud-based ITS applications, offering methodological
advancements for traffic flow forecasting and practical implications for
congestion mitigation.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: In the machine learning system, the hybrid model parallelism combining tensor
parallelism (TP) and pipeline parallelism (PP) has become the dominant solution
for distributed training of Large Language Models~(LLMs) and Multimodal LLMs
(MLLMs). However, TP introduces significant collective communication overheads,
while PP suffers from synchronization inefficiencies such as pipeline bubbles.
Existing works primarily address these challenges from isolated perspectives,
focusing either on overlapping TP communication or on flexible PP scheduling to
mitigate pipeline bubbles. In this paper, we propose a new synergistic tensor
and pipeline parallelism schedule that simultaneously reduces both types of
bubbles. Our proposed schedule decouples the forward and backward passes in PP
into fine-grained computation units, which are then braided to form a composite
computation sequence. This compositional structure enables near-complete
elimination of TP-related bubbles. Building upon this structure, we further
design the PP schedule to minimize PP bubbles. Experimental results demonstrate
that our approach improves training throughput by up to 12% for LLMs and 16%
for MLLMs compared to existing scheduling methods. Our source code is avaiable

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The coordination of large-scale, decentralised systems, such as a fleet of
Electric Vehicles (EVs) in a Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) network, presents a
significant challenge for modern control systems. While collaborative Digital
Twins have been proposed as a solution to manage such systems without
compromising the privacy of individual agents, deriving globally optimal
control policies from the high-level information they share remains an open
problem. This paper introduces Digital Twin Assisted Multi-Agent Deep
Deterministic Policy Gradient (DT-MADDPG) algorithm, a novel hybrid
architecture that integrates a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework
with a collaborative DT network. Our core contribution is a simulation-assisted
learning algorithm where the centralised critic is enhanced by a predictive
global model that is collaboratively built from the privacy-preserving data
shared by individual DTs. This approach removes the need for collecting
sensitive raw data at a centralised entity, a requirement of traditional
multi-agent learning algorithms. Experimental results in a simulated V2G
environment demonstrate that DT-MADDPG can achieve coordination performance
comparable to the standard MADDPG algorithm while offering significant
advantages in terms of data privacy and architectural decentralisation. This
work presents a practical and robust framework for deploying intelligent,
learning-based coordination in complex, real-world cyber-physical systems.

Abstract: Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) delivers low-latency services by hosting
applications near end-users. To promote sustainability, these systems are
increasingly integrated with renewable Energy Harvesting (EH) technologies,
enabling operation where grid electricity is unavailable. However, balancing
the intermittent nature of harvested energy with dynamic user demand presents a
significant resource allocation challenge. This work proposes an online
strategy for an MEC system powered exclusively by EH to address this trade-off.
Our strategy dynamically schedules computational tasks with dependencies and
governs energy consumption through real-time decisions on server frequency
scaling and service module migration. Experiments using real-world datasets
demonstrate our algorithm's effectiveness in efficiently utilizing harvested
energy while maintaining low service latency.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: This paper presents a machine learning (ML)-based heuristic for finding the
optimum sub-system size for the CUDA implementation of the parallel partition
algorithm. Computational experiments for different system of linear algebraic
equation (SLAE) sizes are conducted, and the optimum sub-system size for each
of them is found empirically. To estimate a model for the sub-system size, we
perform the k-nearest neighbors (kNN) classification method. Statistical
analysis of the results is done. By comparing the predicted values with the
actual data, the algorithm is deemed to be acceptably good. Next, the heuristic
is expanded to work for the recursive parallel partition algorithm as well. An
algorithm for determining the optimum sub-system size for each recursive step
is formulated. A kNN model for predicting the optimum number of recursive steps
for a particular SLAE size is built.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Emerging Large Language Model (LLM) system patterns, such as disaggregated
inference, Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) routing, and asynchronous reinforcement
fine-tuning, require flexible point-to-point communication beyond simple
collectives. Existing implementations are locked to specific Network Interface
Controllers (NICs), hindering integration into inference engines and
portability across hardware providers. We present TransferEngine, which bridges
the functionality of common NICs to expose a uniform interface. TransferEngine
exposes one-sided WriteImm operations with a ImmCounter primitive for
completion notification, without ordering assumptions of network transport,
transparently managing multiple NICs per GPU. We demonstrate peak throughput of
400 Gbps on both NVIDIA ConnectX-7 and AWS Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFA). We
showcase TransferEngine through three production systems: (1) KvCache transfer
for disaggregated inference with dynamic scaling, (2) RL weight updates
achieving 1.3 seconds for trillion-parameter models, and (3) MoE
dispatch/combine implementation exceeding DeepEP decode latency on ConnectX-7,
with the first viable latencies on EFA. We demonstrate that our portable
point-to-point communication complements collectives while avoiding lock-in.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) continually evolve through pre-training on
ever-expanding web data, but this adaptive process also exposes them to subtle
forms of misinformation. While prior work has explored data poisoning during
static pre-training, the effects of such manipulations under continual
pre-training remain largely unexplored. Drawing inspiration from the illusory
truth effect in human cognition - where repeated exposure to falsehoods
increases belief in their accuracy - we ask whether LLMs exhibit a similar
vulnerability. We investigate whether repeated exposure to false but
confidently stated facts can shift a model's internal representation away from
the truth.
  We introduce Layer of Truth, a framework and dataset for probing belief
dynamics in continually trained LLMs. By injecting controlled amounts of
poisoned data and probing intermediate representations across checkpoints,
model scales, and question types, we quantify when and how factual beliefs
shift. Our findings reveal that even minimal exposure can induce persistent
representational drift in well-established facts, with susceptibility varying
across layers and model sizes. These results highlight an overlooked
vulnerability of continually updated LLMs: their capacity to internalize
misinformation analogously to humans, underscoring the need for robust
monitoring of factual integrity during model updates.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: In the rapidly evolving field of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL),
understanding the dynamics of open systems is crucial. Openness in MARL refers
to the dynam-ic nature of agent populations, tasks, and agent types with-in a
system. Specifically, there are three types of openness as reported in (Eck et
al. 2023) [2]: agent openness, where agents can enter or leave the system at
any time; task openness, where new tasks emerge, and existing ones evolve or
disappear; and type openness, where the capabil-ities and behaviors of agents
change over time. This report provides a conceptual and empirical review,
focusing on the interplay between openness and the credit assignment problem
(CAP). CAP involves determining the contribution of individual agents to the
overall system performance, a task that becomes increasingly complex in open
environ-ments. Traditional credit assignment (CA) methods often assume static
agent populations, fixed and pre-defined tasks, and stationary types, making
them inadequate for open systems. We first conduct a conceptual analysis,
in-troducing new sub-categories of openness to detail how events like agent
turnover or task cancellation break the assumptions of environmental
stationarity and fixed team composition that underpin existing CAP methods. We
then present an empirical study using representative temporal and structural
algorithms in an open environment. The results demonstrate that openness
directly causes credit misattribution, evidenced by unstable loss functions and
significant performance degradation.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved impressive performance
across diverse tasks by jointly reasoning over textual and visual inputs.
Despite their success, these models remain highly vulnerable to adversarial
manipulations, raising concerns about their safety and reliability in
deployment. In this work, we first generalize an approach for generating
adversarial images within the HuggingFace ecosystem and then introduce
SmoothGuard, a lightweight and model-agnostic defense framework that enhances
the robustness of MLLMs through randomized noise injection and clustering-based
prediction aggregation. Our method perturbs continuous modalities (e.g., images
and audio) with Gaussian noise, generates multiple candidate outputs, and
applies embedding-based clustering to filter out adversarially influenced
predictions. The final answer is selected from the majority cluster, ensuring
stable responses even under malicious perturbations. Extensive experiments on
POPE, LLaVA-Bench (In-the-Wild), and MM-SafetyBench demonstrate that
SmoothGuard improves resilience to adversarial attacks while maintaining
competitive utility. Ablation studies further identify an optimal noise range
(0.1-0.2) that balances robustness and utility.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training without data
sharing, yet participants face a fundamental challenge, e.g., simultaneously
ensuring fairness across demographic groups while protecting sensitive client
data. We introduce a differentially private fair FL algorithm (\textit{FedPF})
that transforms this multi-objective optimization into a zero-sum game where
fairness and privacy constraints compete against model utility. Our theoretical
analysis reveals a surprising inverse relationship, i.e., stricter privacy
protection fundamentally limits the system's ability to detect and correct
demographic biases, creating an inherent tension between privacy and fairness.
Counterintuitively, we prove that moderate fairness constraints initially
improve model generalization before causing performance degradation, where a
non-monotonic relationship that challenges conventional wisdom about
fairness-utility tradeoffs. Experimental validation demonstrates up to 42.9 %
discrimination reduction across three datasets while maintaining competitive
accuracy, but more importantly, reveals that the privacy-fairness tension is
unavoidable, i.e., achieving both objectives simultaneously requires carefully
balanced compromises rather than optimization of either in isolation. The
source code for our proposed algorithm is publicly accessible at
https://github.com/szpsunkk/FedPF.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Speculative decoding has become a widely adopted as an effective technique
for lossless inference acceleration when deploying large language models
(LLMs). While on-the-fly self-speculative methods offer seamless integration
and broad utility, they often fall short of the speed gains achieved by methods
relying on specialized training. Cascading a hierarchy of draft models promises
further acceleration and flexibility, but the high cost of training multiple
models has limited its practical application. In this paper, we propose a novel
Cascade Adaptive Self-Speculative Decoding (CAS-Spec) method which constructs
speculative draft models by leveraging dynamically switchable inference
acceleration (DSIA) strategies, including layer sparsity and activation
quantization. Furthermore, traditional vertical and horizontal cascade
algorithms are inefficient when applied to self-speculative decoding methods.
We introduce a Dynamic Tree Cascade (DyTC) algorithm that adaptively routes the
multi-level draft models and assigns the draft lengths, based on the heuristics
of acceptance rates and latency prediction. Our CAS-Spec method achieves
state-of-the-art acceleration compared to existing on-the-fly speculative
decoding methods, with an average speedup from $1.1\times$ to $2.3\times$ over
autoregressive decoding across various LLMs and datasets. DyTC improves the
average speedup by $47$\% and $48$\% over cascade-based baseline and tree-based
baseline algorithms, respectively. CAS-Spec can be easily integrated into most
existing LLMs and holds promising potential for further acceleration as
self-speculative decoding techniques continue to evolve.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Dynamic offloading of Machine Learning (ML) model partitions across different
resource orchestration services, such as Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) and
Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), can balance processing and transmission
delays while minimizing costs of adaptive inference applications. However,
prior work often overlooks real-world factors, such as Virtual Machine (VM)
cold starts, requests under long-tail service time distributions, etc. To
tackle these limitations, we model each ML query (request) as traversing an
acyclic sequence of stages, wherein each stage constitutes a contiguous block
of sparse model parameters ending in an internal or final classifier where
requests may exit. Since input-dependent exit rates vary, no single resource
configuration suits all query distributions. IaaS-based VMs become
underutilized when many requests exit early, yet rapidly scaling to handle
request bursts reaching deep layers is impractical. SERFLOW addresses this
challenge by leveraging FaaS-based serverless functions (containers) and using
stage-specific resource provisioning that accounts for the fraction of requests
exiting at each stage. By integrating this provisioning with adaptive load
balancing across VMs and serverless functions based on request ingestion,
SERFLOW reduces cloud costs by over $23\%$ while efficiently adapting to
dynamic workloads.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are proficient at generating synthetic
data but continue to suffer from mode collapse, where the generator produces a
narrow range of outputs that fool the discriminator but fail to capture the
full data distribution. This limitation is particularly problematic, as
generative models are increasingly deployed in real-world applications that
demand both diversity and uncertainty awareness. In response, we introduce
BI-DCGAN, a Bayesian extension of DCGAN that incorporates model uncertainty
into the generative process while maintaining computational efficiency.
BI-DCGAN integrates Bayes by Backprop to learn a distribution over network
weights and employs mean-field variational inference to efficiently approximate
the posterior distribution during GAN training. We establishes the first
theoretical proof, based on covariance matrix analysis, that Bayesian modeling
enhances sample diversity in GANs. We validate this theoretical result through
extensive experiments on standard generative benchmarks, demonstrating that
BI-DCGAN produces more diverse and robust outputs than conventional DCGANs,
while maintaining training efficiency. These findings position BI-DCGAN as a
scalable and timely solution for applications where both diversity and
uncertainty are critical, and where modern alternatives like diffusion models
remain too resource-intensive.

Abstract: This work presents an ontology-integrated large language model (LLM)
framework for chemical engineering that unites structured domain knowledge with
generative reasoning. The proposed pipeline aligns model training and inference
with the COPE ontology through a sequence of data acquisition, semantic
preprocessing, information extraction, and ontology mapping steps, producing
templated question-answer pairs that guide fine-tuning. A control-focused
decoding stage and citation gate enforce syntactic and factual grounding by
constraining outputs to ontology-linked terms, while evaluation metrics
quantify both linguistic quality and ontological accuracy. Feedback and future
extensions, including semantic retrieval and iterative validation, further
enhance the system's interpretability and reliability. This integration of
symbolic structure and neural generation provides a transparent, auditable
approach for applying LLMs to process control, safety analysis, and other
critical engineering contexts.

Abstract: The decarbonization of transportation relies on the widespread adoption of
electric vehicles (EVs), which requires an accurate understanding of charging
behavior to ensure cost-effective, grid-resilient infrastructure. Existing work
is constrained by small-scale datasets, simple proximity-based modeling of
temporal dependencies, and weak generalization to sites with limited
operational history. To overcome these limitations, this work proposes a
framework that integrates clustering with few-shot forecasting to uncover site
archetypes using a novel large-scale dataset of charging demand. The results
demonstrate that archetype-specific expert models outperform global baselines
in forecasting demand at unseen sites. By establishing forecast performance as
a basis for infrastructure segmentation, we generate actionable insights that
enable operators to lower costs, optimize energy and pricing strategies, and
support grid resilience critical to climate goals.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have exhibited remarkable progress.
However, deficiencies remain compared to human intelligence, such as
hallucination and shallow pattern matching. In this work, we aim to evaluate a
fundamental yet underexplored intelligence: association, a cornerstone of human
cognition for creative thinking and knowledge integration. Current benchmarks,
often limited to closed-ended tasks, fail to capture the complexity of
open-ended association reasoning vital for real-world applications. To address
this, we present MM-OPERA, a systematic benchmark with 11,497 instances across
two open-ended tasks: Remote-Item Association (RIA) and In-Context Association
(ICA), aligning association intelligence evaluation with human psychometric
principles. It challenges LVLMs to resemble the spirit of divergent thinking
and convergent associative reasoning through free-form responses and explicit
reasoning paths. We deploy tailored LLM-as-a-Judge strategies to evaluate
open-ended outputs, applying process-reward-informed judgment to dissect

Abstract: Next location prediction underpins a growing number of mobility, retail, and
public-health applications, yet its societal impacts remain largely unexplored.
In this paper, we audit state-of-the-art mobility prediction models trained on
a large-scale dataset, highlighting hidden disparities based on user
demographics. Drawing from aggregate census data, we compute the difference in
predictive performance on racial and ethnic user groups and show a systematic
disparity resulting from the underlying dataset, resulting in large differences
in accuracy based on location and user groups. To address this, we propose
Fairness-Guided Incremental Sampling (FGIS), a group-aware sampling strategy
designed for incremental data collection settings. Because individual-level
demographic labels are unavailable, we introduce Size-Aware K-Means (SAKM), a
clustering method that partitions users in latent mobility space while
enforcing census-derived group proportions. This yields proxy racial labels for
the four largest groups in the state: Asian, Black, Hispanic, and White. Built
on these labels, our sampling algorithm prioritizes users based on expected
performance gains and current group representation. This method incrementally
constructs training datasets that reduce demographic performance gaps while
preserving overall accuracy. Our method reduces total disparity between groups
by up to 40\% with minimal accuracy trade-offs, as evaluated on a state-of-art
MetaPath2Vec model and a transformer-encoder model. Improvements are most
significant in early sampling stages, highlighting the potential for
fairness-aware strategies to deliver meaningful gains even in low-resource
settings. Our findings expose structural inequities in mobility prediction
pipelines and demonstrate how lightweight, data-centric interventions can
improve fairness with little added complexity, especially for low-data
applications.

Abstract: The Turing Test is no longer adequate for distinguishing human and machine
intelligence. With advanced artificial intelligence systems already passing the
original Turing Test and contributing to serious ethical and environmental
concerns, we urgently need to update the test. This work expands upon the
original imitation game by accounting for an additional factor: the energy
spent answering the questions. By adding the constraint of energy, the new test
forces us to evaluate intelligence through the lens of efficiency, connecting
the abstract problem of thinking to the concrete reality of finite resources.
Further, this proposed new test ensures the evaluation of intelligence has a
measurable, practical finish line that the original test lacks. This additional
constraint compels society to weigh the time savings of using artificial
intelligence against its total resource cost.

Abstract: Monitoring household water use in rapidly urbanizing regions is hampered by
costly, time-intensive enumeration methods and surveys. We investigate whether
publicly available imagery-satellite tiles, Google Street View (GSV)
segmentation-and simple geospatial covariates (nightlight intensity, population
density) can be utilized to predict household water consumption in
Hubballi-Dharwad, India. We compare four approaches: survey features
(benchmark), CNN embeddings (satellite, GSV, combined), and GSV semantic maps
with auxiliary data. Under an ordinal classification framework, GSV
segmentation plus remote-sensing covariates achieves 0.55 accuracy for water
use, approaching survey-based models (0.59 accuracy). Error analysis shows high
precision at extremes of the household water consumption distribution, but
confusion among middle classes is due to overlapping visual proxies. We also
compare and contrast our estimates for household water consumption to that of
household subjective income. Our findings demonstrate that open-access imagery,
coupled with minimal geospatial data, offers a promising alternative to
obtaining reliable household water consumption estimates using surveys in urban
analytics.

Abstract: This work tackles a critical challenge in AI safety research under limited
compute: given a fixed computation budget, how can one maximize the strength of
iterative adversarial attacks? Coarsely reducing the number of attack
iterations lowers cost but substantially weakens effectiveness. To fulfill the
attainable attack efficacy within a constrained budget, we propose a
fine-grained control mechanism that selectively recomputes layer activations
across both iteration-wise and layer-wise levels. Extensive experiments show
that our method consistently outperforms existing baselines at equal cost.
Moreover, when integrated into adversarial training, it attains comparable
performance with only 30% of the original budget.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) promise more effective
information extraction for review-based recommender systems, yet current
methods still (i) mine free-form reviews without scope control, producing
redundant and noisy representations, (ii) lack principled metrics that link LLM
hallucination to downstream effectiveness, and (iii) leave the cost-quality
trade-off across model scales largely unexplored. We address these gaps with
the Hyper-Adaptive Dual-Stage Semantic Framework (HADSF), a two-stage approach
that first induces a compact, corpus-level aspect vocabulary via adaptive
selection and then performs vocabulary-guided, explicitly constrained
extraction of structured aspect-opinion triples. To assess the fidelity of the
resulting representations, we introduce Aspect Drift Rate (ADR) and Opinion
Fidelity Rate (OFR) and empirically uncover a nonmonotonic relationship between
hallucination severity and rating prediction error. Experiments on
approximately 3 million reviews across LLMs spanning 1.5B-70B parameters show
that, when integrated into standard rating predictors, HADSF yields consistent
reductions in prediction error and enables smaller models to achieve
competitive performance in representative deployment scenarios. We release
code, data pipelines, and metric implementations to support reproducible
research on hallucination-aware, LLM-enhanced explainable recommendation. Code

Abstract: Learning rules -- prescriptions for updating model parameters to improve
performance -- are typically assumed rather than derived. Why do some learning
rules work better than others, and under what assumptions can a given rule be
considered optimal? We propose a theoretical framework that casts learning
rules as policies for navigating (partially observable) loss landscapes, and
identifies optimal rules as solutions to an associated optimal control problem.
A range of well-known rules emerge naturally within this framework under
different assumptions: gradient descent from short-horizon optimization,
momentum from longer-horizon planning, natural gradients from accounting for
parameter space geometry, non-gradient rules from partial controllability, and
adaptive optimizers like Adam from online Bayesian inference of loss landscape
shape. We further show that continual learning strategies like weight resetting
can be understood as optimal responses to task uncertainty. By unifying these
phenomena under a single objective, our framework clarifies the computational
structure of learning and offers a principled foundation for designing adaptive
algorithms.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Multi-armed bandit (MAB) problems serve as a fundamental building block for
more complex reinforcement learning algorithms. However, evaluating and
comparing MAB algorithms remains challenging due to the lack of standardized
conditions and replicability. This is particularly problematic for
variance-aware extensions of classical methods like UCB, whose performance can
heavily depend on the underlying environment. In this study, we address how
performance differences between bandit algorithms can be reliably observed, and
under what conditions variance-aware algorithms outperform classical ones. We
present a reproducible evaluation designed to systematically compare eight
classical and variance-aware MAB algorithms. The evaluation framework,
implemented in our Bandit Playground codebase, features clearly defined
experimental setups, multiple performance metrics (reward, regret, reward
distribution, value-at-risk, and action optimality), and an interactive
evaluation interface that supports consistent and transparent analysis. We show
that variance-aware algorithms can offer advantages in settings with high
uncertainty where the difficulty arises from subtle differences between arm
rewards. In contrast, classical algorithms often perform equally well or better
in more separable scenarios or if fine-tuned extensively. Our contributions are
twofold: (1) a framework for systematic evaluation of MAB algorithms, and (2)
insights into the conditions under which variance-aware approaches outperform
their classical counterparts.

and supports diverse sharding configurations. By pairing Jasmine with curated
large-scale datasets, we establish infrastructure for rigorous benchmarking
pipelines across model families and architectural ablations.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models improve transformer efficiency but lack a
unified theoretical explanation, especially when both feed-forward and
attention layers are allowed to specialize. To this end, we study the
Mixture-of-Transformers (MoT), a tractable theoretical framework in which each
transformer block acts as an expert governed by a continuously trained gating
network. This design allows us to isolate and study the core learning dynamics
of expert specialization and attention alignment. In particular, we develop a
three-stage training algorithm with continuous training of the gating network,
and show that each transformer expert specializes in a distinct class of tasks
and that the gating network accurately routes data samples to the correct
expert. Our analysis shows how expert specialization reduces gradient conflicts
and makes each subtask strongly convex. We prove that the training drives the
expected prediction loss to near zero in $O(\log(\epsilon^{-1}))$ iteration
steps, significantly improving over the $O(\epsilon^{-1})$ rate for a single
transformer. We further validate our theoretical findings through extensive
real-data experiments, demonstrating the practical effectiveness of MoT.
Together, these results offer the first unified theoretical account of
transformer-level specialization and learning dynamics, providing practical
guidance for designing efficient large-scale models.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to sentiment classification using the
application of Combinatorial Fusion Analysis (CFA) to integrate an ensemble of
diverse machine learning models, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy on the
IMDB sentiment analysis dataset of 97.072\%. CFA leverages the concept of
cognitive diversity, which utilizes rank-score characteristic functions to
quantify the dissimilarity between models and strategically combine their
predictions. This is in contrast to the common process of scaling the size of
individual models, and thus is comparatively efficient in computing resource
use. Experimental results also indicate that CFA outperforms traditional
ensemble methods by effectively computing and employing model diversity. The
approach in this paper implements the combination of a transformer-based model
of the RoBERTa architecture with traditional machine learning models, including
Random Forest, SVM, and XGBoost.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We study the problem of length generalization (LG) in transformers: the
ability of a model trained on shorter sequences to maintain performance when
evaluated on much longer, previously unseen inputs. Prior work by Huang et al.
(2025) established that transformers eventually achieve length generalization
once the training sequence length exceeds some finite threshold, but left open
the question of how large it must be. In this work, we provide the first
quantitative bounds on the required training length for length generalization
to occur. Motivated by previous empirical and theoretical work, we analyze LG
in several distinct problem settings: $\ell_\infty$ error control vs. average
error control over an input distribution, infinite-precision softmax attention
vs. finite-precision attention (which reduces to an argmax) in the transformer,
and one- vs. two-layer transformers. In all scenarios, we prove that LG occurs
when the internal behavior of the transformer on longer sequences can be
"simulated" by its behavior on shorter sequences seen during training. Our
bounds give qualitative estimates for the length of training data required for
a transformer to generalize, and we verify these insights empirically. These
results sharpen our theoretical understanding of the mechanisms underlying
extrapolation in transformers, and formalize the intuition that richer training
data is required for generalization on more complex tasks.

Abstract: Mathematical reasoning is a central challenge for large language models
(LLMs), requiring not only correct answers but also faithful reasoning
processes. Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as
a promising approach for enhancing such capabilities; however, its ability to
foster genuine reasoning remains unclear. We investigate RLVR on two
combinatorial problems with fully verifiable solutions: \emph{Activity
Scheduling} and the \emph{Longest Increasing Subsequence}, using carefully
curated datasets with unique optima. Across multiple reward designs, we find
that RLVR improves evaluation metrics but often by reinforcing superficial
heuristics rather than acquiring new reasoning strategies. These findings
highlight the limits of RLVR generalization, emphasizing the importance of
benchmarks that disentangle genuine mathematical reasoning from shortcut
exploitation and provide faithful measures of progress. Code available at

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: An LLM's factuality and refusal training can be compromised by simple changes
to a prompt. Models often adopt user beliefs (sycophancy) or satisfy
inappropriate requests which are wrapped within special text (jailbreaking). We
explore \emph{consistency training}, a self-supervised paradigm that teaches a
model to be invariant to certain irrelevant cues in the prompt. Instead of
teaching the model what exact response to give on a particular prompt, we aim
to teach the model to behave identically across prompt data augmentations (like
adding leading questions or jailbreak text). We try enforcing this invariance
in two ways: over the model's external outputs (\emph{Bias-augmented
Consistency Training} (BCT) from Chua et al. [2025]) and over its internal
activations (\emph{Activation Consistency Training} (ACT), a method we
introduce). Both methods reduce Gemini 2.5 Flash's susceptibility to irrelevant
cues. Because consistency training uses responses from the model itself as
training data, it avoids issues that arise from stale training data, such as
degrading model capabilities or enforcing outdated response guidelines. While
BCT and ACT reduce sycophancy equally well, BCT does better at jailbreak
reduction. We think that BCT can simplify training pipelines by removing
reliance on static datasets. We argue that some alignment problems are better
viewed not in terms of optimal responses, but rather as consistency issues.

Abstract: Given two algorithms for the same problem, can we determine whether they are

Evaluation-Memory-Operations-Complexity framework that embeds algorithm
implementations into a feature space suitable for downstream tasks. We compile
PACD, a curated dataset of verified Python implementations across three
problems, and show that EMOC features support clustering and classification of
algorithm types, detection of near-duplicates, and quantification of diversity
in LLM-generated programs. Code, data, and utilities for computing EMOC
embeddings are released to facilitate reproducibility and future work on

Abstract: Recent advances in large language model (LLM) reasoning, led by reinforcement

where models improve by generating and solving their own problems. While
self-play has shown strong in-domain and out-of-domain gains, the mechanisms
behind these improvements remain poorly understood. In this work, we analyze
the training dynamics of self-play through the lens of the Absolute Zero
Reasoner, comparing it against RLVR and supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Our study
examines parameter update sparsity, entropy dynamics of token distributions,
and alternative proposer reward functions. We further connect these dynamics to
reasoning performance using pass@k evaluations. Together, our findings clarify
how self-play differs from other post-training strategies, highlight its
inherent limitations, and point toward future directions for improving LLM math
reasoning through self-play.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Aggregating intracranial recordings across subjects is challenging since
electrode count, placement, and covered regions vary widely. Spatial
normalization methods like MNI coordinates offer a shared anatomical reference,
but often fail to capture true functional similarity, particularly when
localization is imprecise; even at matched anatomical coordinates, the targeted
brain region and underlying neural dynamics can differ substantially between
individuals. We propose a scalable representation-learning framework that (i)
learns a subject-agnostic functional identity for each electrode from
multi-region local field potentials using a Siamese encoder with contrastive
objectives, inducing an embedding geometry that is locality-sensitive to
region-specific neural signatures, and (ii) tokenizes these embeddings for a
transformer that models inter-regional relationships with a variable number of
channels. We evaluate this framework on a 20-subject dataset spanning basal
ganglia-thalamic regions collected during flexible rest/movement recording
sessions with heterogeneous electrode layouts. The learned functional space
supports accurate within-subject discrimination and forms clear,
region-consistent clusters; it transfers zero-shot to unseen channels. The
transformer, operating on functional tokens without subject-specific heads or
supervision, captures cross-region dependencies and enables reconstruction of
masked channels, providing a subject-agnostic backbone for downstream decoding.
Together, these results indicate a path toward large-scale, cross-subject
aggregation and pretraining for intracranial neural data where strict task
structure and uniform sensor placement are unavailable.

Abstract: Quantum theory provides non-classical principles, such as superposition and
entanglement, that inspires promising paradigms in machine learning. However,
most existing quantum-inspired fusion models rely solely on unitary or
unitary-like transformations to generate quantum entanglement. While
theoretically expressive, such approaches often suffer from training
instability and limited generalizability. In this work, we propose a
Quantum-inspired Neural Network with Quantum Jump (QiNN-QJ) for multimodal
entanglement modelling. Each modality is firstly encoded as a quantum pure
state, after which a differentiable module simulating the QJ operator
transforms the separable product state into the entangled representation. By
jointly learning Hamiltonian and Lindblad operators, QiNN-QJ generates
controllable cross-modal entanglement among modalities with dissipative
dynamics, where structured stochasticity and steady-state attractor properties
serve to stabilize training and constrain entanglement shaping. The resulting
entangled states are projected onto trainable measurement vectors to produce
predictions. In addition to achieving superior performance over the
state-of-the-art models on benchmark datasets, including CMU-MOSI, CMU-MOSEI,
and CH-SIMS, QiNN-QJ facilitates enhanced post-hoc interpretability through
von-Neumann entanglement entropy. This work establishes a principled framework
for entangled multimodal fusion and paves the way for quantum-inspired
approaches in modelling complex cross-modal correlations.

Abstract: Bulk tissue RNA sequencing of heterogeneous samples provides averaged gene
expression profiles, obscuring cell type-specific dynamics. To address this, we
present a probabilistic hierarchical Bayesian model that deconvolves bulk
RNA-seq data into constituent cell-type expression profiles and proportions,
leveraging a high-resolution single-cell reference. We apply our model to human
endometrial tissue across the menstrual cycle, a context characterized by
dramatic hormone-driven cellular composition changes. Our extended framework
provides a principled inference of cell type proportions and cell-specific gene
expression changes across cycle phases. We demonstrate the model's structure,
priors, and inference strategy in detail, and we validate its performance with
simulations and comparisons to existing methods. The results reveal dynamic
shifts in epithelial, stromal, and immune cell fractions between menstrual
phases, and identify cell-type-specific differential gene expression associated
with endometrial function (e.g., decidualization markers in stromal cells
during the secretory phase). We further conduct robustness tests and show that
our Bayesian approach is resilient to reference mismatches and noise. Finally,
we discuss the biological significance of our findings, potential clinical
implications for fertility and endometrial disorders, and future directions,
including integration of spatial transcriptomics.

Abstract: Offline contextual bandits allow one to learn policies from
historical/offline data without requiring online interaction. However, offline
policy optimization that maximizes overall expected rewards can unintentionally
amplify the reward disparities across groups. As a result, some groups might
benefit more than others from the learned policy, raising concerns about
fairness, especially when the resources are limited. In this paper, we study a
group-sensitive fairness constraint in offline contextual bandits, reducing
group-wise reward disparities that may arise during policy learning. We tackle
the following common-parity requirements: the reward disparity is constrained
within some user-defined threshold or the reward disparity should be minimized
during policy optimization. We propose a constrained offline policy
optimization framework by introducing group-wise reward disparity constraints
into an off-policy gradient-based optimization procedure. To improve the
estimation of the group-wise reward disparity during training, we employ a
doubly robust estimator and further provide a convergence guarantee for policy
optimization. Empirical results in synthetic and real-world datasets
demonstrate that our method effectively reduces reward disparities while
maintaining competitive overall performance.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) agents are emerging as transformative tools in
drug discovery, with the ability to autonomously reason, act, and learn through
complicated research workflows. Building on large language models (LLMs)
coupled with perception, computation, action, and memory tools, these agentic
AI systems could integrate diverse biomedical data, execute tasks, carry out
experiments via robotic platforms, and iteratively refine hypotheses in closed

architectures, ranging from ReAct and Reflection to Supervisor and Swarm
systems, and illustrate their applications across key stages of drug discovery,
including literature synthesis, toxicity prediction, automated protocol
generation, small-molecule synthesis, drug repurposing, and end-to-end
decision-making. To our knowledge, this represents the first comprehensive work
to present real-world implementations and quantifiable impacts of agentic AI
systems deployed in operational drug discovery settings. Early implementations
demonstrate substantial gains in speed, reproducibility, and scalability,
compressing workflows that once took months into hours while maintaining

Abstract: This study explored the utilities of rationales generated by GPT-4.1 and
GPT-5 in automated scoring using Prompt 6 essays from the 2012 Kaggle ASAP
data. Essay-based scoring was compared with rationale-based scoring. The study
found in general essay-based scoring performed better than rationale-based
scoring with higher Quadratic Weighted Kappa (QWK). However, rationale-based
scoring led to higher scoring accuracy in terms of F1 scores for score 0 which
had less representation due to class imbalance issues. The ensemble modeling of
essay-based scoring models increased the scoring accuracy at both specific
score levels and across all score levels. The ensemble modeling of essay-based
scoring and each of the rationale-based scoring performed about the same.
Further ensemble of essay-based scoring and both rationale-based scoring
yielded the best scoring accuracy with QWK of 0.870 compared with 0.848
reported in literature.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Due to the growing concern about unsavory behaviors of machine learning
models toward certain demographic groups, the notion of 'fairness' has recently
drawn much attention from the community, thereby motivating the study of
fairness in graph clustering. Fair graph clustering aims to partition the set
of nodes in a graph into $k$ disjoint clusters such that the proportion of each
protected group within each cluster is consistent with the proportion of that
group in the entire dataset. It is, however, computationally challenging to
incorporate fairness constraints into existing graph clustering algorithms,
particularly for large graphs. To address this problem, we propose FairAD, a
computationally efficient fair graph clustering method. It first constructs a
new affinity matrix based on the notion of algebraic distance such that
fairness constraints are imposed. A graph coarsening process is then performed
on this affinity matrix to find representative nodes that correspond to $k$
clusters. Finally, a constrained minimization problem is solved to obtain the
solution of fair clustering. Experiment results on the modified stochastic
block model and six public datasets show that FairAD can achieve fair
clustering while being up to 40 times faster compared to state-of-the-art fair
graph clustering algorithms.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Database Management Systems (DBMSs) are fundamental for managing large-scale
and heterogeneous data, and their performance is critically influenced by
configuration parameters. Effective tuning of these parameters is essential for
adapting to diverse workloads and maximizing throughput while minimizing
latency. Recent research has focused on automated configuration optimization
using machine learning; however, existing approaches still exhibit several key
limitations. Most tuning frameworks disregard the dependencies among
parameters, assuming that each operates independently. This simplification
prevents optimizers from leveraging relational effects across parameters,
limiting their capacity to capture performancesensitive interactions. Moreover,
to reduce the complexity of the high-dimensional search space, prior work often
selects only the top few parameters for optimization, overlooking others that
contribute meaningfully to performance. Bayesian Optimization (BO), the most
common method for automatic tuning, is also constrained by its reliance on
surrogate models, which can lead to unstable predictions and inefficient
exploration. To overcome these limitations, we propose RelTune, a novel
framework that represents parameter dependencies as a Relational Graph and
learns GNN-based latent embeddings that encode performancerelevant semantics.
RelTune further introduces Hybrid-Score-Guided Bayesian Optimization (HBO),
which combines surrogate predictions with an Affinity Score measuring proximity
to previously high-performing configurations. Experimental results on multiple
DBMSs and workloads demonstrate that RelTune achieves faster convergence and
higher optimization efficiency than conventional BO-based methods, achieving
state-of-the-art performance across all evaluated scenarios.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Finding lower and better-generalizing minima is crucial for deep learning.
However, most existing optimizers stop searching the parameter space once they
reach a local minimum. Given the complex geometric properties of the loss
landscape, it is difficult to guarantee that such a point is the lowest or
provides the best generalization. To address this, we propose an adaptor "E"
for gradient-based optimizers. The adapted optimizer tends to continue
exploring along landscape valleys (areas with low and nearly identical losses)
in order to search for potentially better local minima even after reaching a
local minimum. This approach increases the likelihood of finding a lower and
flatter local minimum, which is often associated with better generalization. We
also provide a proof of convergence for the adapted optimizers in both convex
and non-convex scenarios for completeness. Finally, we demonstrate their
effectiveness in an important but notoriously difficult training scenario,
large-batch training, where Lamb is the benchmark optimizer. Our testing
results show that the adapted Lamb, ALTO, increases the test accuracy
(generalization) of the current state-of-the-art optimizer by an average of
2.5% across a variety of large-batch training tasks. This work potentially
opens a new research direction in the design of optimization algorithms.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Harmful fine-tuning poses critical safety risks to fine-tuning-as-a-service
for large language models. Existing defense strategies preemptively build
robustness via attack simulation but suffer from fundamental limitations: (i)
the infeasibility of extending attack simulations beyond bounded threat models
due to the inherent difficulty of anticipating unknown attacks, and (ii)
limited adaptability to varying attack settings, as simulation fails to capture
their variability and complexity. To address these challenges, we propose
Bayesian Data Scheduler (BDS), an adaptive tuning-stage defense strategy with
no need for attack simulation. BDS formulates harmful fine-tuning defense as a
Bayesian inference problem, learning the posterior distribution of each data
point's safety attribute, conditioned on the fine-tuning and alignment
datasets. The fine-tuning process is then constrained by weighting data with
their safety attributes sampled from the posterior, thus mitigating the
influence of harmful data. By leveraging the post hoc nature of Bayesian
inference, the posterior is conditioned on the fine-tuning dataset, enabling
BDS to tailor its defense to the specific dataset, thereby achieving adaptive
defense. Furthermore, we introduce a neural scheduler based on amortized
Bayesian learning, enabling efficient transfer to new data without retraining.
Comprehensive results across diverse attack and defense settings demonstrate
the state-of-the-art performance of our approach. Code is available at
https://github.com/Egg-Hu/Bayesian-Data-Scheduler.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of online sparse linear regression (OSLR)
where the algorithms are restricted to accessing only $k$ out of $d$ attributes
per instance for prediction, which was proved to be NP-hard. Previous work gave
polynomial-time algorithms assuming the data matrix satisfies the linear
independence of features, the compatibility condition, or the restricted
isometry property. We introduce a new polynomial-time algorithm, which
significantly improves previous regret bounds (Ito et al., 2017) under the
compatibility condition that is weaker than the other two assumptions. The
improvements benefit from a tighter convergence rate of the $\ell_1$-norm error
of our estimators. Our algorithm leverages the well-studied Dantzig Selector,
but importantly with several novel techniques, including an algorithm-dependent
sampling scheme for estimating the covariance matrix, an adaptive parameter
tuning scheme, and a batching online Newton step with careful initializations.
We also give novel and non-trivial analyses, including an induction method for
analyzing the $\ell_1$-norm error, careful analyses on the covariance of
non-independent random variables, and a decomposition on the regret. We further
extend our algorithm to OSLR with additional observations where the algorithms
can observe additional $k_0$ attributes after each prediction, and improve
previous regret bounds (Kale et al., 2017; Ito et al., 2017).

Abstract: Traffic accidents represent a critical public health challenge, claiming over
1.35 million lives annually worldwide. Traditional accident prediction models
treat road segments independently, failing to capture complex spatial
relationships and temporal dependencies in urban transportation networks. This
study develops MDAS-GNN, a Multi-Dimensional Attention-based Spatial-diffusion
Graph Neural Network integrating three core risk dimensions: traffic safety,
infrastructure, and environmental risk. The framework employs feature-specific
spatial diffusion mechanisms and multi-head temporal attention to capture
dependencies across different time horizons. Evaluated on UK Department for
Transport accident data across Central London, South Manchester, and SE
Birmingham, MDASGNN achieves superior performance compared to established
baseline methods. The model maintains consistently low prediction errors across
short, medium, and long-term periods, with particular strength in long-term
forecasting. Ablation studies confirm that integrated multi-dimensional
features outperform singlefeature approaches, reducing prediction errors by up
to 40%. This framework provides civil engineers and urban planners with
advanced predictive capabilities for transportation infrastructure design,
enabling data-driven decisions for road network optimization, infrastructure
resource improvements, and strategic safety interventions in urban development
projects.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Explainable AI (XAI) is critical for building trust in complex machine
learning models, yet mainstream attribution methods often provide an
incomplete, static picture of a model's final state. By collapsing a feature's
role into a single score, they are confounded by non-linearity and
interactions. To address this, we introduce Feature-Function Curvature Analysis
(FFCA), a novel framework that analyzes the geometry of a model's learned
function. FFCA produces a 4-dimensional signature for each feature, quantifying
its: (1) Impact, (2) Volatility, (3) Non-linearity, and (4) Interaction.
Crucially, we extend this framework into Dynamic Archetype Analysis, which
tracks the evolution of these signatures throughout the training process. This
temporal view moves beyond explaining what a model learned to revealing how it
learns. We provide the first direct, empirical evidence of hierarchical
learning, showing that models consistently learn simple linear effects before
complex interactions. Furthermore, this dynamic analysis provides novel,
practical diagnostics for identifying insufficient model capacity and
predicting the onset of overfitting. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate
that FFCA, through its static and dynamic components, provides the essential
geometric context that transforms model explanation from simple quantification
to a nuanced, trustworthy analysis of the entire learning process.

Abstract: Equivariant representation learning aims to capture variations induced by
input transformations in the representation space, whereas invariant
representation learning encodes semantic information by disregarding such
transformations. Recent studies have shown that jointly learning both types of
representations is often beneficial for downstream tasks, typically by
employing separate projection heads. However, this design overlooks information
shared between invariant and equivariant learning, which leads to redundant
feature learning and inefficient use of model capacity. To address this, we
introduce Soft Task-Aware Routing (STAR), a routing strategy for projection
heads that models them as experts. STAR induces the experts to specialize in
capturing either shared or task-specific information, thereby reducing
redundant feature learning. We validate this effect by observing lower
canonical correlations between invariant and equivariant embeddings.
Experimental results show consistent improvements across diverse transfer
learning tasks. The code is available at https://github.com/YonseiML/star.

Abstract: Dataset distillation condenses large datasets into synthetic subsets,
achieving performance comparable to training on the full dataset while
substantially reducing storage and computation costs. Most existing dataset
distillation methods assume that all real instances contribute equally to the
process. In practice, real-world datasets contain both informative and
redundant or even harmful instances, and directly distilling the full dataset
without considering data quality can degrade model performance. In this work,
we present Influence-Weighted Distillation IWD, a principled framework that
leverages influence functions to explicitly account for data quality in the
distillation process. IWD assigns adaptive weights to each instance based on
its estimated impact on the distillation objective, prioritizing beneficial
data while downweighting less useful or harmful ones. Owing to its modular
design, IWD can be seamlessly integrated into diverse dataset distillation
frameworks. Our empirical results suggest that integrating IWD tends to improve
the quality of distilled datasets and enhance model performance, with accuracy
gains of up to 7.8%.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel in diverse multimodal tasks. However,
user requirements vary across scenarios, which can be categorized into fast
response, high-quality output, and low energy consumption. Relying solely on
large models deployed in the cloud for all queries often leads to high latency
and energy cost, while small models deployed on edge devices are capable of
handling simpler tasks with low latency and energy cost. To fully leverage the
strengths of both large and small models, we propose ECVL-ROUTER, the first
scenario-aware routing framework for VLMs. Our approach introduces a new
routing strategy and evaluation metrics that dynamically select the appropriate
model for each query based on user requirements, maximizing overall utility. We
also construct a multimodal response-quality dataset tailored for router
training and validate the approach through extensive experiments. Results show
that our approach successfully routes over 80\% of queries to the small model
while incurring less than 10\% drop in problem solving probability.

Abstract: Recently, there has been gradually more attention paid to Out-of-Distribution
(OOD) performance prediction, whose goal is to predict the performance of
trained models on unlabeled OOD test datasets, so that we could better leverage
and deploy off-the-shelf trained models in risk-sensitive scenarios. Although
progress has been made in this area, evaluation protocols in previous
literature are inconsistent, and most works cover only a limited number of
real-world OOD datasets and types of distribution shifts. To provide convenient
and fair comparisons for various algorithms, we propose Out-of-Distribution
Performance Prediction Benchmark (ODP-Bench), a comprehensive benchmark that
includes most commonly used OOD datasets and existing practical performance
prediction algorithms. We provide our trained models as a testbench for future
researchers, thus guaranteeing the consistency of comparison and avoiding the
burden of repeating the model training process. Furthermore, we also conduct
in-depth experimental analyses to better understand their capability boundary.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of Drug-Target Affinity (DTA) is crucial for reducing
experimental costs and accelerating early screening in computational drug
discovery. While sequence-based deep learning methods avoid reliance on costly
3D structures, they still overlook simultaneous modeling of global sequence
semantic features and local topological structural features within drugs and
proteins, and represent drugs as flat sequences without atomic-level,
substructural-level, and molecular-level multi-scale features. We propose
HiF-DTA, a hierarchical network that adopts a dual-pathway strategy to extract
both global sequence semantic and local topological features from drug and
protein sequences, and models drugs multi-scale to learn atomic, substructural,
and molecular representations fused via a multi-scale bilinear attention
module. Experiments on Davis, KIBA, and Metz datasets show HiF-DTA outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines, with ablations confirming the importance of
global-local extraction and multi-scale fusion.

Abstract: The oscillations of the human heart rate are inherently complex and

monitoring in everyday life. In this work, we study the non-linear chaotic
behavior of heart rate through mutual information and introduce a novel

complexity from a mathematical perspective but also improves the deep learning
solutions when combined with them. We validate our proposed method on four
established datasets from real-life scenarios and compare its performance with
existing algorithms thoroughly with extensive ablation experiments. Our results
demonstrate a substantial improvement, up to 40\%, of the proposed approach in
estimating heart rate compared to traditional methods and existing

Abstract: With the growing volume of Internet of Things (IoT) network traffic, machine
learning (ML)-based anomaly detection is more relevant than ever. Traditional
batch learning models face challenges such as high maintenance and poor
adaptability to rapid anomaly changes, known as concept drift. In contrast,
streaming learning integrates online and incremental learning, enabling
seamless updates and concept drift detection to improve robustness. This study
investigates anomaly detection in streaming IoT traffic as binary
classification, comparing batch and streaming learning approaches while
assessing the limitations of current IoT traffic datasets. We simulated
heterogeneous network data streams by carefully mixing existing datasets and
streaming the samples one by one. Our results highlight the failure of batch
models to handle concept drift, but also reveal persisting limitations of
current datasets to expose model limitations due to low traffic heterogeneity.
We also investigated the competitiveness of tree-based ML algorithms,
well-known in batch anomaly detection, and compared it to non-tree-based ones,
confirming the advantages of the former. Adaptive Random Forest achieved
F1-score of 0.990 $\pm$ 0.006 at one-third the computational cost of its batch
counterpart. Hoeffding Adaptive Tree reached F1-score of 0.910 $\pm$ 0.007,
reducing computational cost by four times, making it a viable choice for online
applications despite a slight trade-off in stability.

Abstract: Understanding how language-model outputs relate to the pretraining corpus is
central to studying model behavior. Most training data attribution (TDA)
methods ask which training examples causally influence a given output, often
using leave-one-out tests. We invert the question: which outputs cannot be
attributed to any pretraining example? We introduce un-attributability as an
operational measure of semantic novelty: an output is novel if the pretraining
corpus contains no semantically similar context. We approximate this with a
simple two-stage retrieval pipeline: index the corpus with lightweight GIST
embeddings, retrieve the top-n candidates, then rerank with ColBERTv2. If the
nearest corpus item is less attributable than a human-generated text reference,
we consider the output of the model as novel. We evaluate on SmolLM and SmolLM2
and report three findings: (1) models draw on pretraining data across much
longer spans than previously reported; (2) some domains systematically promote
or suppress novelty; and (3) instruction tuning not only alters style but also
increases novelty. Reframing novelty assessment around un-attributability
enables efficient analysis at pretraining scale. We release ~20 TB of corpus
chunks and index artifacts to support replication and large-scale extension of
our analysis at https://huggingface.co/datasets/stai-tuebingen/faiss-smollm

Abstract: The inherent multimodality and heterogeneous temporal structures of medical
data pose significant challenges for modeling. We propose MedM2T, a time-aware
multimodal framework designed to address these complexities. MedM2T integrates:
(i) Sparse Time Series Encoder to flexibly handle irregular and sparse time
series, (ii) Hierarchical Time-Aware Fusion to capture both micro- and
macro-temporal patterns from multiple dense time series, such as ECGs, and
(iii) Bi-Modal Attention to extract cross-modal interactions, which can be
extended to any number of modalities. To mitigate granularity gaps between
modalities, MedM2T uses modality-specific pre-trained encoders and aligns
resulting features within a shared encoder. We evaluated MedM2T on MIMIC-IV and
MIMIC-IV-ECG datasets for three tasks that encompass chronic and acute disease
dynamics: 90-day cardiovascular disease (CVD) prediction, in-hospital mortality
prediction, and ICU length-of-stay (LOS) regression. MedM2T outperformed
state-of-the-art multimodal learning frameworks and existing time series
models, achieving an AUROC of 0.947 and an AUPRC of 0.706 for CVD prediction;
an AUROC of 0.901 and an AUPRC of 0.558 for mortality prediction; and Mean
Absolute Error (MAE) of 2.31 for LOS regression. These results highlight the
robustness and broad applicability of MedM2T, positioning it as a promising

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Language models trained via outcome-based reinforcement learning (RL) to
reason using chain-of-thought (CoT) have shown remarkable performance.
Monitoring such a model's CoT may allow us to understand its intentions and
detect potential malicious behavior. However, to be effective, this requires
that CoTs are legible and faithful. We study CoT legibility across 14 reasoning
models, finding that RL often causes reasoning to become illegible to both
humans and AI monitors, with reasoning models (except Claude) generating
illegible CoTs while returning to perfectly readable final answers. We show
that models use illegible reasoning to reach correct answers (accuracy dropping
by 53\% when forced to use only legible portions), yet find no correlation
between legibility and performance when resampling - suggesting the
relationship is more nuanced. We also find that legibility degrades on harder
questions. We discuss potential hypotheses for these results, including
steganography, training artifacts, and vestigial tokens. These results suggest
that without explicit optimization for legibility, outcome-based RL naturally
produces models with increasingly opaque reasoning processes, potentially
undermining monitoring approaches.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) outputs let us read a model's step-by-step reasoning.
Since any long, serial reasoning process must pass through this textual trace,
the quality of the CoT is a direct window into what the model is thinking. This
visibility could help us spot unsafe or misaligned behavior (monitorability),
but only if the CoT is transparent about its internal reasoning (faithfulness).
Fully measuring faithfulness is difficult, so researchers often focus on
examining the CoT in cases where the model changes its answer after adding a
cue to the input. This proxy finds some instances of unfaithfulness but loses
information when the model maintains its answer, and does not investigate
aspects of reasoning not tied to the cue. We extend these results to a more
holistic sense of monitorability by introducing verbosity: whether the CoT
lists every factor needed to solve the task. We combine faithfulness and
verbosity into a single monitorability score that shows how well the CoT serves
as the model's external `working memory', a property that many safety schemes
based on CoT monitoring depend on. We evaluate instruction-tuned and reasoning
models on BBH, GPQA, and MMLU. Our results show that models can appear faithful
yet remain hard to monitor when they leave out key factors, and that
monitorability differs sharply across model families. We release our evaluation
code using the Inspect library to support reproducible future work.

Abstract: The core bottleneck of Federated Learning (FL) lies in the communication
rounds. That is, how to achieve more effective local updates is crucial for
reducing communication rounds. Existing FL methods still primarily use
element-wise local optimizers (Adam/SGD), neglecting the geometric structure of
the weight matrices. This often leads to the amplification of pathological
directions in the weights during local updates, leading deterioration in the
condition number and slow convergence. Therefore, we introduce the Muon
optimizer in local, which has matrix orthogonalization to optimize
matrix-structured parameters. Experimental results show that, in IID setting,
Local Muon significantly accelerates the convergence of FL and reduces
communication rounds compared to Local SGD and Local AdamW. However, in non-IID
setting, independent matrix orthogonalization based on the local distributions
of each client induces strong client drift. Applying Muon in non-IID FL poses
significant challenges: (1) client preconditioner leading to client drift; (2)
moment reinitialization. To address these challenges, we propose a novel
Federated Muon optimizer (FedMuon), which incorporates two key techniques: (1)
momentum aggregation, where clients use the aggregated momentum for local
initialization; (2) local-global alignment, where the local gradients are
aligned with the global update direction to significantly reduce client drift.
Theoretically, we prove that \texttt{FedMuon} achieves a linear speedup
convergence rate without the heterogeneity assumption, where $S$ is the number
of participating clients per round, $K$ is the number of local iterations, and
$R$ is the total number of communication rounds. Empirically, we validate the
effectiveness of FedMuon on language and vision models. Compared to several
baselines, FedMuon significantly reduces communication rounds and improves test
accuracy.

Abstract: Interpretability is crucial for building safe, reliable, and controllable
language models, yet existing interpretability pipelines remain costly and
difficult to scale. Interpreting a new model typically requires costly training
of model-specific sparse autoencoders, manual or semi-automated labeling of SAE
components, and their subsequent validation. We introduce Atlas-Alignment, a
framework for transferring interpretability across language models by aligning
unknown latent spaces to a Concept Atlas - a labeled, human-interpretable
latent space - using only shared inputs and lightweight representational
alignment techniques. Once aligned, this enables two key capabilities in
previously opaque models: (1) semantic feature search and retrieval, and (2)
steering generation along human-interpretable atlas concepts. Through
quantitative and qualitative evaluations, we show that simple representational
alignment methods enable robust semantic retrieval and steerable generation
without the need for labeled concept data. Atlas-Alignment thus amortizes the
cost of explainable AI and mechanistic interpretability: by investing in one
high-quality Concept Atlas, we can make many new models transparent and
controllable at minimal marginal cost.

Abstract: Understanding post-wildfire vegetation loss is critical for developing
effective ecological recovery strategies and is often challenging due to the
extended time and effort required to capture the evolving ecosystem features.
Recent works in this area have not fully explored all the contributing factors,
their modalities, and interactions with each other. Furthermore, most research
in this domain is limited by a lack of interpretability in predictive modeling,
making it less useful in real-world settings. In this work, we propose a novel
end-to-end ML pipeline called MVeLMA (\textbf{M}ultimodal \textbf{Ve}getation
\textbf{L}oss \textbf{M}odeling \textbf{A}rchitecture) to predict county-wise
vegetation loss from fire events. MVeLMA uses a multimodal feature integration
pipeline and a stacked ensemble-based architecture to capture different
modalities while also incorporating uncertainty estimation through
probabilistic modeling. Through comprehensive experiments, we show that our
model outperforms several state-of-the-art (SOTA) and baseline models in
predicting post-wildfire vegetation loss. Furthermore, we generate vegetation
loss confidence maps to identify high-risk counties, thereby helping targeted
recovery efforts. The findings of this work have the potential to inform future
disaster relief planning, ecological policy development, and wildlife recovery
management.

Abstract: Graphs are central to modeling complex systems in domains such as social
networks, molecular chemistry, and neuroscience. While Graph Neural Networks,
particularly Graph Convolutional Networks, have become standard tools for graph
learning, they remain constrained by reliance on fixed structures and
susceptibility to over-smoothing. We propose the Spectral Preservation Network,
a new framework for graph representation learning that generates reduced graphs
serving as faithful proxies of the original, enabling downstream tasks such as
community detection, influence propagation, and information diffusion at a
reduced computational cost. The Spectral Preservation Network introduces two
key components: the Joint Graph Evolution layer and the Spectral Concordance
loss. The former jointly transforms both the graph topology and the node
feature matrix, allowing the structure and attributes to evolve adaptively
across layers and overcoming the rigidity of static neighborhood aggregation.
The latter regularizes these transformations by enforcing consistency in both
the spectral properties of the graph and the feature vectors of the nodes. We
evaluate the effectiveness of Spectral Preservation Network on node-level
sparsification by analyzing well-established metrics and benchmarking against
state-of-the-art methods. The experimental results demonstrate the superior
performance and clear advantages of our approach.

Abstract: We propose a method for learning and sampling from probability distributions
supported on the simplex. Our approach maps the open simplex to Euclidean space
via smooth bijections, leveraging the Aitchison geometry to define the
mappings, and supports modeling categorical data by a Dirichlet interpolation
that dequantizes discrete observations into continuous ones. This enables
density modeling in Euclidean space through the bijection while still allowing
exact recovery of the original discrete distribution. Compared to previous
methods that operate on the simplex using Riemannian geometry or custom noise
processes, our approach works in Euclidean space while respecting the Aitchison
geometry, and achieves competitive performance on both synthetic and real-world
data sets.

Abstract: Most work interpreting reasoning models studies only a single
chain-of-thought (CoT), yet these models define distributions over many
possible CoTs. We argue that studying a single sample is inadequate for
understanding causal influence and the underlying computation. Though fully
specifying this distribution is intractable, it can be understood by sampling.
We present case studies using resampling to investigate model decisions. First,
when a model states a reason for its action, does that reason actually cause
the action? In "agentic misalignment" scenarios, we resample specific sentences
to measure their downstream effects. Self-preservation sentences have small
causal impact, suggesting they do not meaningfully drive blackmail. Second, are
artificial edits to CoT sufficient for steering reasoning? These are common in
literature, yet take the model off-policy. Resampling and selecting a
completion with the desired property is a principled on-policy alternative. We
find off-policy interventions yield small and unstable effects compared to
resampling in decision-making tasks. Third, how do we understand the effect of
removing a reasoning step when the model may repeat it post-edit? We introduce
a resilience metric that repeatedly resamples to prevent similar content from
reappearing downstream. Critical planning statements resist removal but have
large effects when eliminated. Fourth, since CoT is sometimes "unfaithful", can
our methods teach us anything in these settings? Adapting causal mediation
analysis, we find that hints that have a causal effect on the output without
being explicitly mentioned exert a subtle and cumulative influence on the CoT
that persists even if the hint is removed. Overall, studying distributions via
resampling enables reliable causal analysis, clearer narratives of model
reasoning, and principled CoT interventions.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: AdamW has become one of the most effective optimizers for training
large-scale models. We have also observed its effectiveness in the context of
federated learning (FL). However, directly applying AdamW in federated learning
settings poses significant challenges: (1) due to data heterogeneity, AdamW
often yields high variance in the second-moment estimate $\boldsymbol{v}$; (2)
the local overfitting of AdamW may cause client drift; and (3) Reinitializing
moment estimates ($\boldsymbol{v}$, $\boldsymbol{m}$) at each round slows down
convergence. To address these challenges, we propose the first
\underline{Fed}erated \underline{AdamW} algorithm, called \texttt{FedAdamW},
for training and fine-tuning various large models. \texttt{FedAdamW} aligns
local updates with the global update using both a \textbf{local correction
mechanism} and decoupled weight decay to mitigate local overfitting.
\texttt{FedAdamW} efficiently aggregates the \texttt{mean} of the second-moment
estimates to reduce their variance and reinitialize them. Theoretically, we
prove that \texttt{FedAdamW} achieves a linear speedup convergence rate of
$\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{(L \Delta \sigma_l^2)/(S K R \epsilon^2)}+(L \Delta)/R)$
without \textbf{heterogeneity assumption}, where $S$ is the number of
participating clients per round, $K$ is the number of local iterations, and $R$
is the total number of communication rounds. We also employ PAC-Bayesian
generalization analysis to explain the effectiveness of decoupled weight decay
in local training. Empirically, we validate the effectiveness of
\texttt{FedAdamW} on language and vision Transformer models. Compared to
several baselines, \texttt{FedAdamW} significantly reduces communication rounds
and improves test accuracy. The code is available in

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: To prevent inference attacks in Federated Learning (FL) and reduce the
leakage of sensitive information, Client-level Differentially Private Federated
Learning (CL-DPFL) is widely used. However, current CL-DPFL methods usually
result in sharper loss landscapes, which leads to a decrease in model
generalization after differential privacy protection. By using Sharpness Aware
Minimization (SAM), the current popular federated learning methods are to find
a local flat minimum value to alleviate this problem. However, the local
flatness may not reflect the global flatness in CL-DPFL. Therefore, to address
this issue and seek global flat minima of models, we propose a new CL-DPFL
algorithm, DP-FedPGN, in which we introduce a global gradient norm penalty to
the local loss to find the global flat minimum. Moreover, by using our global
gradient norm penalty, we not only find a flatter global minimum but also
reduce the locally updated norm, which means that we further reduce the error
of gradient clipping. From a theoretical perspective, we analyze how DP-FedPGN
mitigates the performance degradation caused by DP. Meanwhile, the proposed
DP-FedPGN algorithm eliminates the impact of data heterogeneity and achieves
fast convergence. We also use R\'enyi DP to provide strict privacy guarantees
and provide sensitivity analysis for local updates. Finally, we conduct
effectiveness tests on both ResNet and Transformer models, and achieve
significant improvements in six visual and natural language processing tasks
compared to existing state-of-the-art algorithms. The code is available at

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The conjugate gradient solver (CG) is a prevalent method for solving
symmetric and positive definite linear systems Ax=b, where effective
preconditioners are crucial for fast convergence. Traditional preconditioners
rely on prescribed algorithms to offer rigorous theoretical guarantees, while
limiting their ability to exploit optimization from data. Existing
learning-based methods often utilize Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to improve
the performance and speed up the construction. However, their reliance on
incomplete factorization leads to significant challenges: the associated
triangular solve hinders GPU parallelization in practice, and introduces
long-range dependencies which are difficult for GNNs to model. To address these
issues, we propose a learning-based method to generate GPU-friendly
preconditioners, particularly using GNNs to construct Sparse Approximate
Inverse (SPAI) preconditioners, which avoids triangular solves and requires
only two matrix-vector products at each CG step. The locality of matrix-vector
product is compatible with the local propagation mechanism of GNNs. The
flexibility of GNNs also allows our approach to be applied in a wide range of
scenarios. Furthermore, we introduce a statistics-based scale-invariant loss
function. Its design matches CG's property that the convergence rate depends on
the condition number, rather than the absolute scale of A, leading to improved
performance of the learned preconditioner. Evaluations on three PDE-derived
datasets and one synthetic dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms
standard preconditioners (Diagonal, IC, and traditional SPAI) and previous
learning-based preconditioners on GPUs. We reduce solution time on GPUs by
40%-53% (68%-113% faster), along with better condition numbers and superior
generalization performance. Source code available at

Abstract: Foundation models for time series are emerging as powerful general-purpose
backbones, yet their potential for domain-specific biomedical signals such as
electroencephalography (EEG) remains rather unexplored. In this work, we
investigate the applicability a recently proposed time series classification
foundation model, to a different EEG tasks such as motor imagery classification
and sleep stage prediction. We test two pretraining regimes: (a) pretraining on
heterogeneous real-world time series from multiple domains, and (b) pretraining
on purely synthetic data. We find that both variants yield strong performance,
consistently outperforming EEGNet, a widely used convolutional baseline, and
CBraMod, the most recent EEG-specific foundation model. These results suggest
that generalist time series foundation models, even when pretrained on data of
non-neural origin or on synthetic signals, can transfer effectively to EEG. Our
findings highlight the promise of leveraging cross-domain pretrained models for
brain signal analysis, suggesting that EEG may benefit from advances in the
broader time series literature.

Abstract: Data for training structural health monitoring (SHM) systems are often
expensive and/or impractical to obtain, particularly for labelled data.
Population-based SHM (PBSHM) aims to address this limitation by leveraging data
from multiple structures. However, data from different structures will follow
distinct distributions, potentially leading to large generalisation errors for
models learnt via conventional machine learning methods. To address this issue,
transfer learning -- in the form of domain adaptation (DA) -- can be used to
align the data distributions. Most previous approaches have only considered
\emph{unsupervised} DA, where no labelled target data are available; they do
not consider how to incorporate these technologies in an online framework --
updating as labels are obtained throughout the monitoring campaign. This paper
proposes a Bayesian framework for DA in PBSHM, that can improve unsupervised DA
mappings using a limited quantity of labelled target data. In addition, this
model is integrated into an active sampling strategy to guide inspections to
select the most informative observations to label -- leading to further
reductions in the required labelled data to learn a target classifier. The
effectiveness of this methodology is evaluated on a population of experimental
bridges. Specifically, this population includes data corresponding to several
damage states, as well as, a comprehensive set of environmental conditions. It
is found that combining transfer learning and active learning can improve data
efficiency when learning classification models in label-scarce scenarios. This
result has implications for data-informed operation and maintenance of
structures, suggesting a reduction in inspections over the operational lifetime
of a structure -- and therefore a reduction in operational costs -- can be
achieved.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) training is prohibitively expensive, driving
interest in low-precision fully-quantized training (FQT). While novel 4-bit
formats like NVFP4 offer substantial efficiency gains, achieving near-lossless
training at such low precision remains challenging. We introduce TetraJet-v2,
an end-to-end 4-bit FQT method that leverages NVFP4 for activations, weights,
and gradients in all linear layers. We identify two critical issues hindering
low-precision LLM training: weight oscillation and outliers. To address these,
we propose: 1) an unbiased double-block quantization method for NVFP4 linear
layers, 2) OsciReset, an algorithm to suppress weight oscillation, and 3)
OutControl, an algorithm to retain outlier accuracy. TetraJet-v2 consistently
outperforms prior FP4 training methods on pre-training LLMs across varying
model sizes up to 370M and data sizes up to 200B tokens, reducing the
performance gap to full-precision training by an average of 51.3%.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) shows significant promise in
knowledge-intensive tasks by improving domain specificity, enhancing temporal
relevance, and reducing hallucinations. However, applying RAG to finance
encounters critical challenges: restricted access to proprietary datasets,
limited retrieval accuracy, regulatory constraints, and sensitive data
interpretation. We introduce AstuteRAG-FQA, an adaptive RAG framework tailored
for Financial Question Answering (FQA), leveraging task-aware prompt
engineering to address these challenges. The framework uses a hybrid retrieval
strategy integrating both open-source and proprietary financial data while
maintaining strict security protocols and regulatory compliance. A dynamic
prompt framework adapts in real time to query complexity, improving precision
and contextual relevance. To systematically address diverse financial queries,
we propose a four-tier task classification: explicit factual, implicit factual,
interpretable rationale, and hidden rationale involving implicit causal
reasoning. For each category, we identify key challenges, datasets, and
optimization techniques within the retrieval and generation process. The
framework incorporates multi-layered security mechanisms including differential
privacy, data anonymization, and role-based access controls to protect
sensitive financial information. Additionally, AstuteRAG-FQA implements
real-time compliance monitoring through automated regulatory validation systems
that verify responses against industry standards and legal obligations. We
evaluate three data integration techniques - contextual embedding, small model
augmentation, and targeted fine-tuning - analyzing their efficiency and
feasibility across varied financial environments.

Abstract: Formulating optimization problems for industrial applications demands
significant manual effort and domain expertise. While Large Language Models
(LLMs) show promise in automating this process, evaluating their performance
remains difficult due to the absence of robust metrics. Existing solver-based
approaches often face inconsistency, infeasibility issues, and high
computational costs. To address these issues, we propose ORGEval, a
graph-theoretic evaluation framework for assessing LLMs' capabilities in
formulating linear and mixed-integer linear programs. ORGEval represents
optimization models as graphs, reducing equivalence detection to graph
isomorphism testing. We identify and prove a sufficient condition, when the
tested graphs are symmetric decomposable (SD), under which the
Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) test is guaranteed to correctly detect isomorphism.
Building on this, ORGEval integrates a tailored variant of the WL-test with an
SD detection algorithm to evaluate model equivalence. By focusing on structural
equivalence rather than instance-level configurations, ORGEval is robust to
numerical variations. Experimental results show that our method can
successfully detect model equivalence and produce 100\% consistent results
across random parameter configurations, while significantly outperforming
solver-based methods in runtime, especially on difficult problems. Leveraging
ORGEval, we construct the Bench4Opt dataset and benchmark state-of-the-art LLMs
on optimization modeling. Our results reveal that although optimization
modeling remains challenging for all LLMs, DeepSeek-V3 and Claude-Opus-4
achieve the highest accuracies under direct prompting, outperforming even
leading reasoning models.

Abstract: Supervised learning is classically formulated as training a model to minimize
a fixed loss function over a fixed distribution, or task. However, an emerging
paradigm instead views model training as extracting enough information from
data so that the model can be used to minimize many losses on many downstream
tasks. We formalize a mathematical framework for this paradigm, which we call
panprediction, and study its statistical complexity. Formally, panprediction
generalizes omniprediction and sits upstream from multi-group learning, which
respectively focus on predictions that generalize to many downstream losses or
many downstream tasks, but not both. Concretely, we design algorithms that
learn deterministic and randomized panpredictors with
$\tilde{O}(1/\varepsilon^3)$ and $\tilde{O}(1/\varepsilon^2)$ samples,
respectively. Our results demonstrate that under mild assumptions,
simultaneously minimizing infinitely many losses on infinitely many tasks can
be as statistically easy as minimizing one loss on one task. Along the way, we
improve the best known sample complexity guarantee of deterministic
omniprediction by a factor of $1/\varepsilon$, and match all other known sample
complexity guarantees of omniprediction and multi-group learning. Our key
technical ingredient is a nearly lossless reduction from panprediction to a
statistically efficient notion of calibration, called step calibration.

Abstract: Class imbalance poses a fundamental challenge in machine learning, frequently

In a counterfactual explanations-based approach, we propose to leverage
Explainable AI to jointly identify and eliminate CH effects emerging under
imbalance. Our method achieves competitive classification performance on three
datasets and demonstrates how CH effects emerge under imbalance, a perspective

Abstract: Modern deep neural networks (DNNs) are typically trained with a global
cross-entropy loss in a supervised end-to-end manner: neurons need to store
their outgoing weights; training alternates between a forward pass
(computation) and a top-down backward pass (learning) which is biologically
implausible. Alternatively, greedy layer-wise training eliminates the need for
cross-entropy loss and backpropagation. By avoiding the computation of
intermediate gradients and the storage of intermediate outputs, it reduces
memory usage and helps mitigate issues such as vanishing or exploding
gradients. However, most existing layer-wise training approaches have been
evaluated only on relatively small datasets with simple deep architectures. In
this paper, we first systematically analyze the training dynamics of popular
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained by stochastic gradient descent
(SGD) through an information-theoretic lens. Our findings reveal that networks
converge layer-by-layer from bottom to top and that the flow of information
adheres to a Markov information bottleneck principle. Building on these
observations, we propose a novel layer-wise training approach based on the
recently developed deterministic information bottleneck (DIB) and the
matrix-based R\'enyi's $\alpha$-order entropy functional. Specifically, each
layer is trained jointly with an auxiliary classifier that connects directly to
the output layer, enabling the learning of minimal sufficient task-relevant
representations. We empirically validate the effectiveness of our training
procedure on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 using modern deep CNNs and further
demonstrate its applicability to a practical task involving traffic sign
recognition. Our approach not only outperforms existing layer-wise training
baselines but also achieves performance comparable to SGD.
