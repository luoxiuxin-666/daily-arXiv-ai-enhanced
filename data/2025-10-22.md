Abstract: The well-known Condorcet Jury Theorem states that, under majority rule, the
better of two alternatives is chosen with probability approaching one as the
population grows. We study an asymmetric setting where voters face varying
participation costs and share a possibly heuristic belief about their
pivotality (ability to influence the outcome).
  In a costly voting setup where voters abstain if their participation cost is
greater than their pivotality estimate, we identify a single property of the
heuristic belief -- weakly vanishing pivotality -- that gives rise to multiple
stable equilibria in which elections are nearly tied. In contrast, strongly
vanishing pivotality (as in the standard Calculus of Voting model) yields a
unique, trivial equilibrium where only zero-cost voters participate as the
population grows. We then characterize when nontrivial equilibria satisfy a
version of the Jury Theorem: below a sharp threshold, the majority-preferred
candidate wins with probability approaching one; above it, both candidates
either win with equal probability.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: In this work, we introduce and study contextual search in general
principal-agent games, where a principal repeatedly interacts with agents by
offering contracts based on contextual information and historical feedback,
without knowing the agents' true costs or rewards. Our model generalizes
classical contextual pricing by accommodating richer agent action spaces. Over
$T$ rounds with $d$-dimensional contexts, we establish an asymptotically tight
exponential $T^{1 - \Theta(1/d)}$ bound in terms of the pessimistic Stackelberg
regret, benchmarked against the best utility for the principal that is
consistent with the observed feedback.
  We also establish a lower bound of $\Omega(T^{\frac{1}{2}-\frac{1}{2d}})$ on
the classic Stackelberg regret for principal-agent games, demonstrating a
surprising double-exponential hardness separation from the contextual pricing
problem (a.k.a, the principal-agent game with two actions), which is known to
admit a near-optimal $O(d\log\log T)$ regret bound [Kleinberg and Leighton,
2003, Leme and Schneider, 2018, Liu et al., 2021]. In particular, this
double-exponential hardness separation occurs even in the special case with
three actions and two-dimensional context. We identify that this significant
increase in learning difficulty arises from a structural phenomenon that we
call contextual action degeneracy, where adversarially chosen contexts can make
some actions strictly dominated (and hence unincentivizable), blocking the
principal's ability to explore or learn about them, and fundamentally limiting
learning progress.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We study the approval-based multi-winner election problem where $n$ voters
jointly decide a committee of $k$ winners from $m$ candidates. We focus on the
axiom \emph{average justified representation} (AJR) proposed by Fernandez,
Elkind, Lackner, Garcia, Arias-Fisteus, Basanta-Val, and Skowron (2017). AJR
postulates that every group of voters with a common preference should be
sufficiently represented in that their average satisfaction should be no less
than their Hare quota. Formally, for every group of
$\lceil\ell\cdot\frac{n}{k}\rceil$ voters with $\ell$ common approved
candidates, the average number of approved winners for this group should be at
least $\ell$. It is well-known that a winning committee satisfying AJR is not
guaranteed to exist for all multi-winner election instances. In this paper, we
study the likelihood of the existence of AJR under the Erd\H{o}s--R\'enyi
model. We consider the Erd\H{o}s--R\'enyi model parameterized by $p\in[0,1]$
that samples multi-winner election instances from the distribution where each
voter approves each candidate with probability $p$ (and the events that voters
approve candidates are independent), and we provide a clean and complete
characterization of the existence of AJR committees in the case where $m$ is a
constant and $n$ tends to infinity. We show that there are two phase transition
points $p_1$ and $p_2$ (with $p_1\leq p_2$) for the parameter $p$ such that: 1)
when $p<p_1$ or $p>p_2$, an AJR committee exists with probability $1-o(1)$, 2)
when $p_1<p<p_2$, an AJR committee exists with probability $o(1)$, and 3) when
$p=p_1$ or $p=p_2$, the probability that an AJR committee exists is bounded
away from both $0$ and $1$.

Abstract: With the growing role of artificial intelligence in climate and weather
research, efficient model training and inference are in high demand. Current
models like FourCastNet and AI-GOMS depend heavily on GPUs, limiting hardware
independence, especially for Chinese domestic hardware and frameworks. To
address this issue, we present a framework for migrating large-scale
atmospheric and oceanic models from PyTorch to MindSpore and optimizing for
Chinese chips, and evaluating their performance against GPUs. The framework
focuses on software-hardware adaptation, memory optimization, and parallelism.
Furthermore, the model's performance is evaluated across multiple metrics,
including training speed, inference speed, model accuracy, and energy
efficiency, with comparisons against GPU-based implementations. Experimental
results demonstrate that the migration and optimization process preserves the
models' original accuracy while significantly reducing system dependencies and
improving operational efficiency by leveraging Chinese chips as a viable
alternative for scientific computing. This work provides valuable insights and
practical guidance for leveraging Chinese domestic chips and frameworks in
atmospheric and oceanic AI model development, offering a pathway toward greater
technological independence.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Recent advances in distributed learning systems have introduced effective
solutions for implementing collaborative artificial intelligence techniques in
wireless communication networks. Federated learning approaches provide a
model-aggregation mechanism among edge devices to achieve collaborative
training, while ensuring data security, communication efficiency, and sharing
computational overheads. On the other hand, limited transmission resources and
complex communication environments remain significant bottlenecks to the
efficient collaborations among edge devices, particularly within large-scale
networks. To address such issues, this paper proposes an over-the-air (OTA)
analog aggregation method designed for the distributed swarm learning (DSL),
termed DSL-OTA, aiming to enhance communication efficiency, enable effective
cooperation, and ensure privacy preserving. Incorporating multi-worker
selection strategy with over-the-air aggregation not only makes the standard
DSL based on single best worker contributing to global model update to become
more federated, but also secures the aggregation from potential risks of data
leakage. Our theoretical analyses verify the advantages of the proposed DSL-OTA
algorithm in terms of fast convergence rate and low communication costs.
Simulation results reveal that our DSL-OTA outperforms the other existing
methods by achieving better learning performance under both homogeneous and
heterogeneous dataset settings.

Abstract: Large-scale GPU traces play a critical role in identifying performance
bottlenecks within heterogeneous High-Performance Computing (HPC)
architectures. However, the sheer volume and complexity of a single trace of
data make performance analysis both computationally expensive and
time-consuming. To address this challenge, we present an end-to-end parallel
performance analysis framework designed to handle multiple large-scale GPU
traces efficiently. Our proposed framework partitions and processes trace data
concurrently and employs causal graph methods and parallel coordinating chart
to expose performance variability and dependencies across execution flows.
Experimental results demonstrate a 67% improvement in terms of scalability,
highlighting the effectiveness of our pipeline for analyzing multiple traces
independently.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), as the foundational architecture for
next-generation interactive AI applications, not only power intelligent
dialogue systems but also drive the evolution of embodied intelligence on edge
devices, including humanoid robots, smart vehicles, and other scenarios. The
applications running on these edge devices impose differentiated Service Level
Objectives (SLO) requirements on LLM services, specifically manifested as
distinct constraints on Time to First Token (TTFT) and Time Per Output Token
(TPOT) as well as end-to-end latency. Notably, edge devices typically handle
real-time tasks that are extremely sensitive to latency, such as machine
control and navigation planning. However, existing scheduling service systems
still prioritize maximizing output token throughput as the sole optimization
objective, failing to adequately address the diversity of SLO requirements.
This ultimately results in persistently high violation rates for end-to-end
latency or TPOT related SLOs.
  This paper proposes SLICE, an innovative scheduling solution designed for
edge computing scenarios with differentiated SLO requirements. By combining a
utility-maximizing request scheduling algorithm with a dynamic iterative
control mechanism for generation rates, SLICE significantly improves LLM
inference service SLO attainment. Experimental results demonstrate that
compared to state-of-the-art solutions Orca and FastServe, SLICE achieves up to
35x higher SLO attainment and 3.4x advantage in task completion time than the
other two solutions.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in complex multi-agent
applications that use external function calls. This workload creates severe
performance challenges for the KV Cache: space contention leads to the eviction
of critical agents' caches and time underutilization leaves the cache of agents
stalled on long-running tool calls idling in GPU memory. We present Tokencake,
a KV-Cache-centric serving framework that co-optimizes scheduling and memory
management with an agent-aware design. Tokencake's Space Scheduler uses dynamic
memory partitioning to shield critical agents from contention, while its Time
Scheduler employs a proactive offload and predictive upload mechanism to
repurpose GPU memory during function call stalls. Our evaluation on
representative multi-agent benchmarks shows that Tokencake can reduce
end-to-end latency by over 47.06%, improve effective GPU memory utilization by
up to 16.9% compared to vLLM.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We provide new communication-efficient distributed interactive proofs for
planarity. The notion of a \emph{distributed interactive proof (DIP)} was
introduced by Kol, Oshman, and Saxena (PODC 2018). In a DIP, the \emph{prover}
is a single centralized entity whose goal is to prove a certain claim regarding
an input graph $G$. To do so, the prover communicates with a distributed
\emph{verifier} that operates concurrently on all $n$ nodes of $G$. A DIP is
measured by the amount of prover-verifier communication it requires. Namely,
the goal is to design a DIP with a small number of interaction rounds and a
small \emph{proof size}, i.e., a small amount of communication per round. Our
main result is an $O(\log ^{*}n)$-round DIP protocol for embedded planarity and
planarity with a proof size of $O(1)$ and $O(\lceil\log \Delta/\log
^{*}n\rceil)$, respectively. In fact, this result can be generalized as
follows. For any $1\leq r\leq \log^{*}n$, there exists an $O(r)$-round protocol
for embedded planarity and planarity with a proof size of $O(\log ^{(r)}n)$ and
$O(\log ^{(r)}n+\log \Delta /r)$, respectively.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Performance regressions in large-scale software systems can lead to
substantial resource inefficiencies, making their early detection critical.
Frequent benchmarking is essential for identifying these regressions and
maintaining service-level agreements (SLAs). Performance benchmarks, however,
are resource-intensive and time-consuming, which is a major challenge for
integration into Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)
pipelines. Although numerous benchmark optimization techniques have been
proposed to accelerate benchmark execution, there is currently no practical
system that integrates these optimizations seamlessly into real-world CI/CD
pipelines. In this vision paper, we argue that the field of benchmark
optimization remains under-explored in key areas that hinder its broader
adoption. We identify three central challenges to enabling frequent and
efficient benchmarking: (a) the composability of benchmark optimization
strategies, (b) automated evaluation of benchmarking results, and (c) the
usability and complexity of applying these strategies as part of CI/CD systems
in practice. We also introduce a conceptual cloud-based benchmarking framework
handling these challenges transparently. By presenting these open problems, we
aim to stimulate research toward making performance regression detection in
CI/CD systems more practical and effective.

Abstract: This paper presents the Parallel Coupler for Multimodel Simulations (PCMS), a

utilize discretization and field information to accommodate physics
constraints. PCMS is demonstrated with a coupling of the gyrokinetic
microturbulence code XGC with a Monte Carlo neutral transport code DEGAS2 and
with a 5D distribution function coupling of an energetic particle transport
code (GNET) to a gyrokinetic microturbulence code (GTC). Weak scaling is also
demonstrated on up to 2,080 GPUs of Frontier with a weak scaling efficiency of
85%.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Despite remarkable advances in Large Language Model capabilities, tool
retrieval for agent-based systems remains fundamentally limited by reliance on
semantic similarity, which fails to capture functional viability. Current
methods often retrieve textually relevant but functionally inoperative tools
due to parameter mismatches, authentication failures, and execution
constraints--a phenomenon we term the semantic-functional gap. We introduce
GRETEL, to address this gap through systematic empirical validation. GRETEL
implements an agentic workflow that processes semantically retrieved candidates
through sandboxed plan-execute-evaluate cycles, generating execution-grounded
evidence to distinguish truly functional tools from merely descriptive matches.
Our comprehensive evaluation on the ToolBench benchmark demonstrates
substantial improvements across all metrics: Pass Rate (at 10) increases from
0.690 to 0.826, Recall (at 10) improves from 0.841 to 0.867, and NDCG (at 10)
rises from 0.807 to 0.857.. These results establish that execution-based
validation provides a more reliable foundation for tool selection than semantic
similarity alone, enabling more robust agent performance in real-world
applications.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Prognostic Health Management (PHM) systems monitor and predict equipment
health. A key task is Remaining Useful Life (RUL) estimation, which predicts
how long a component, such as a rolling element bearing, will operate before
failure. Many RUL methods exist but often lack generalizability and robustness
under changing operating conditions. This paper introduces CARLE, a hybrid AI
framework that combines deep and shallow learning to address these challenges.
CARLE uses Res-CNN and Res-LSTM blocks with multi-head attention and residual
connections to capture spatial and temporal degradation patterns, and a Random
Forest Regressor (RFR) for stable, accurate RUL prediction. A compact
preprocessing pipeline applies Gaussian filtering for noise reduction and
Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) for time-frequency feature extraction. We
evaluate CARLE on the XJTU-SY and PRONOSTIA bearing datasets. Ablation studies
measure each component's contribution, while noise and cross-domain experiments
test robustness and generalization. Comparative results show CARLE outperforms
several state-of-the-art methods, especially under dynamic conditions. Finally,
we analyze model interpretability with LIME and SHAP to assess transparency and
trustworthiness.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Finding Nash equilibria in imperfect-information games remains a central
challenge in multi-agent reinforcement learning. While regularization-based
methods have recently achieved last-iteration convergence to a regularized
equilibrium, they require the regularization strength to shrink toward zero to
approximate a Nash equilibrium, often leading to unstable learning in practice.
Instead, we fix the regularization strength at a large value for robustness and
achieve convergence by iteratively refining the reference policy. Our main
theoretical result shows that this procedure guarantees strictly monotonic
improvement and convergence to an exact Nash equilibrium in two-player zero-sum
games, without requiring a uniqueness assumption. Building on this framework,
we develop a practical algorithm, Nash Policy Gradient (NashPG), which
preserves the generalizability of policy gradient methods while relying solely
on the current and reference policies. Empirically, NashPG achieves comparable
or lower exploitability than prior model-free methods on classic benchmark
games and scales to large domains such as Battleship and No-Limit Texas
Hold'em, where NashPG consistently attains higher Elo ratings.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have led to a surge of open-source models
across diverse domains. While model merging offers a promising way to combine
their strengths, existing approaches often suffer from parameter conflicts that
degrade performance on domain-specific tasks. We propose MIN-Merging, a
router-based framework that selectively merges the most important neurons to
reduce such conflicts. Extensive experiments on Computer Vision(CV) and Natural
Language Processing(NLP) benchmarks show that MIN-Merging achieves consistent
gains on in-domain tasks while retaining the generalization ability of
pretrained models on out-of-domain tasks. These results highlight its
effectiveness as a practical solution to the parameter conflict problem in
model merging.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative decentralized training across
multiple parties (nodes) while keeping raw data private. There are two main
paradigms in FL: Horizontal FL (HFL), where all participant nodes share the
same feature space but hold different samples, and Vertical FL (VFL), where
participants hold complementary features for the same samples. While HFL is
widely adopted, VFL is employed in domains where nodes hold complementary
features about the same samples. Still, VFL presents a significant limitation:
the vast number of communications required during training. This compromises
privacy and security, and can lead to high energy consumption, and in some
cases, make model training unfeasible due to the high number of communications.
  In this paper, we introduce Sherpa.ai Blind Vertical Federated Learning
(SBVFL), a novel paradigm that leverages a distributed training mechanism
enhanced for privacy and security. Decoupling the vast majority of node updates
from the server dramatically reduces node-server communication. Experiments
show that SBVFL reduces communication by ~99% compared to standard VFL while
maintaining accuracy and robustness. Therefore, SBVFL enables practical,
privacy-preserving VFL across sensitive domains, including healthcare, finance,
manufacturing, aerospace, cybersecurity, and the defense industry.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into real-world
applications, raising concerns about privacy, security and the need to remove
undesirable knowledge. Machine Unlearning has emerged as a promising solution,
yet faces two key challenges: (1) practical unlearning needs are often
continuous and heterogeneous, and (2) they involve decentralized, sensitive
data with asymmetric access. These factors result in inter-domain and
intra-domain interference, which further amplifies the dilemma of unbalanced
forgetting and retaining performance. In response, we propose a federated
unlearning approach for LLMs that is scalable and privacy preserving. Our
method decouples unlearning and retention via task-specific adapter learning
and employs a hierarchical merging strategy to mitigate conflicting objectives
and enables robust, adaptable unlearning updates. Comprehensive experiments on
benchmarks of WMDP, MUSE, and TOFU showed that our approach effectively handles
heterogeneous unlearning requests while maintaining strong LLM utility compared
with baseline methods.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We present core attention disaggregation (CAD), a technique that improves
long-context large language model training by decoupling the core attention
computation, softmax(QK^T)V, from the rest of the model and executing it on a
separate pool of devices. In existing systems, core attention is colocated with
other layers; at long context lengths, its quadratic compute growth compared to
the near-linear growth of other components causes load imbalance and stragglers
across data and pipeline parallel groups. CAD is enabled by two observations.
First, core attention is stateless: it has no trainable parameters and only
minimal transient data, so balancing reduces to scheduling compute-bound tasks.
Second, it is composable: modern attention kernels retain high efficiency when
processing fused batches of token-level shards with arbitrary lengths. CAD
partitions core attention into token-level tasks and dispatches them to
dedicated attention servers, which dynamically rebatch tasks to equalize
compute without sacrificing kernel efficiency. We implement CAD in a system
called DistCA, which uses a ping-pong execution scheme to fully overlap
communication with computation and in-place execution on attention servers to
reduce memory use. On 512 H200 GPUs and context lengths up to 512k tokens,
DistCA improves end-to-end training throughput by up to 1.35x, eliminates data
and pipeline parallel stragglers, and achieves near-perfect compute and memory
balance.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable
success, yet their standard attention mechanism incurs quadratic computation
and memory costs with respect to sequence length, posing a major bottleneck for
long-context training. Prior work tackles this challenge along two directions:
(1) kernel-level optimizations, which accelerate dense and sparse attention
operators; and (2) module-level strategies, often referred to as distributed
attention or context parallel training, which scale attention across multiple
devices. However, systematic evaluation still remains limited: operator-level
comparisons are often incomplete, while context parallel strategies are
typically framework-specific, with unclear performance analysis across
contexts. To address these gaps, we propose a unified benchmark that integrates
representative attention kernels and context parallel mechanisms with a modular
and extensible interface for evaluation. The benchmark evaluates methods along
two critical dimensions: (1) attention mask patterns, which strongly affect
efficiency, scalability, and usability, and (2) sequence length and distributed
scale, which determine performance under extreme long-context training. Through
comprehensive experiments on the cluster of up to 96 GPUs, our benchmark
enables reproducible comparisons, highlights method-specific trade-offs, and
provides practical guidance for designing and deploying attention mechanisms in
long-context LLM training.

Abstract: The Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture enables the scaling of Large
Language Models (LLMs) to trillions of parameters by activating a sparse subset
of weights for each input, maintaining constant computational cost during
inference. Concurrently, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a dominant
technique for parameter-efficiently fine-tuning LLMs on specialized tasks. In
this work, we unify these two paradigms into a novel, end-to-end trainable
framework named L-MoE: a Lightweight Mixture of LoRA Experts. L-MoE redefines
MoE experts not as dense feed-forward networks, but as a collection of
task-specialized, low-rank adapters. A lightweight gating network, trained
jointly with the experts, learns to dynamically compose these LoRA adapters by
computing a weighted average of their parameters for each input token. This
composition is fully differentiable, allowing gradients from a standard
auto-regressive language modeling objective to flow back through the entire
architecture, simultaneously refining both the expert adapters and the routing
strategy. This approach creates a highly parameter-efficient MoE model that is
modular by design, allows for dynamic skill composition, and is trainable from
end-to-end. We present the formal mathematical framework for L-MoE, detailing
the differentiable routing mechanism and the joint optimization objective,
thereby providing a new path toward building more efficient, scalable, and
specialized language models.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Automatic performance tuning (auto-tuning) is essential for optimizing
high-performance applications, where vast and irregular parameter spaces make
manual exploration infeasible. Traditionally, auto-tuning relies on
well-established optimization algorithms such as evolutionary algorithms,
annealing methods, or surrogate model-based optimizers to efficiently find
near-optimal configurations. However, designing effective optimizers remains
challenging, as no single method performs best across all tuning tasks.
  In this work, we explore a new paradigm: using large language models (LLMs)
to automatically generate optimization algorithms tailored to auto-tuning
problems. We introduce a framework that prompts LLMs with problem descriptions
and search-space characteristics results to produce specialized optimization
strategies, which are iteratively examined and improved.
  These generated algorithms are evaluated on four real-world auto-tuning
applications across six hardware platforms and compared against the
state-of-the-art in optimization algorithms of two contemporary auto-tuning
frameworks. The evaluation demonstrates that providing additional application-
and search space-specific information in the generation stage results in an
average performance improvement of 30.7\% and 14.6\%, respectively. In
addition, our results show that LLM-generated optimizers can rival, and in
various cases outperform, existing human-designed algorithms, with our
best-performing generated optimization algorithms achieving, on average, 72.4\%
improvement over state-of-the-art optimizers for auto-tuning.

Abstract: We introduce NeuCo-Bench, a novel benchmark framework for evaluating (lossy)
neural compression and representation learning in the context of Earth
Observation (EO). Our approach builds on fixed-size embeddings that act as
compact, task-agnostic representations applicable to a broad range of
downstream tasks. NeuCo-Bench comprises three core components: (i) an
evaluation pipeline built around reusable embeddings, (ii) a new challenge mode
with a hidden-task leaderboard designed to mitigate pretraining bias, and (iii)
a scoring system that balances accuracy and stability. To support
reproducibility, we release SSL4EO-S12-downstream, a curated multispectral,
multitemporal EO dataset. We present initial results from a public challenge at
the 2025 CVPR EARTHVISION workshop and conduct ablations with state-of-the-art
foundation models. NeuCo-Bench provides a first step towards community-driven,
standardized evaluation of neural embeddings for EO and beyond.

Abstract: Despite extensive research on neural network calibration, existing methods
typically apply global transformations that treat all predictions uniformly,
overlooking the heterogeneous reliability of individual predictions.
Furthermore, the relationship between improved calibration and effective
uncertainty-aware decision-making remains largely unexplored. This paper
presents a post-hoc calibration framework that leverages prediction reliability
assessment to jointly enhance calibration quality and uncertainty-aware
decision-making. The framework employs proximity-based conformal prediction to
stratify calibration samples into putatively correct and putatively incorrect
groups based on semantic similarity in feature space. A dual calibration
strategy is then applied: standard isotonic regression calibrated confidence in
putatively correct predictions, while underconfidence-regularized isotonic
regression reduces confidence toward uniform distributions for putatively
incorrect predictions, facilitating their identification for further
investigations. A comprehensive evaluation is conducted using calibration
metrics, uncertainty-aware performance measures, and empirical conformal
coverage. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 with BiT and CoAtNet backbones
show that the proposed method achieves lower confidently incorrect predictions,
and competitive Expected Calibration Error compared with isotonic and
focal-loss baselines. This work bridges calibration and uncertainty
quantification through instance-level adaptivity, offering a practical post-hoc
solution that requires no model retraining while improving both probability
alignment and uncertainty-aware decision-making.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Data unlearning aims to remove the influence of specific training samples
from a trained model without requiring full retraining. Unlike concept
unlearning, data unlearning in diffusion models remains underexplored and often
suffers from quality degradation or incomplete forgetting. To address this, we
first observe that most existing methods attempt to unlearn the samples at all
diffusion time steps equally, leading to poor-quality generation. We argue that
forgetting occurs disproportionately across time and frequency, depending on
the model and scenarios. By selectively focusing on specific time-frequency
ranges during training, we achieve samples with higher aesthetic quality and
lower noise. We validate this improvement by applying our time-frequency
selective approach to diverse settings, including gradient-based and preference
optimization objectives, as well as both image-level and text-to-image tasks.
Finally, to evaluate both deletion and quality of unlearned data samples, we
propose a simple normalized version of SSCD. Together, our analysis and methods
establish a clearer understanding of the unique challenges in data unlearning
for diffusion models, providing practical strategies to improve both evaluation
and unlearning performance.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for advancing
Large Language Models (LLMs), achieving remarkable performance in complex
reasoning domains such as mathematics and code generation. However, current RL
methods face a fundamental scalability bottleneck due to their heavy reliance
on human-curated preference data or labeled datasets for reward modeling. To
overcome this limitation, we explore RL on unlabeled data where models learn
autonomously from continuous experience streams. The core challenge in this
setting lies in reliable reward estimation without ground-truth supervision.
Existing approaches like Test-Time RL address this through self-consistent
consensus, but risk reinforcing incorrect pseudo-labels derived from majority
voting. We introduce COMPASS (Composite Path and Answer Self-Scoring), a novel
test-time reward mechanism that operates without external supervision. COMPASS
integrates two complementary components: the Dual-Calibration Answer Reward
(DCAR), which stabilizes training by establishing trustworthy pseudo-labels
through confidence and credibility calibration, and the Decisive Path Reward
(DPR), which directly optimizes the reasoning process quality beyond mere
outcome supervision. By jointly reinforcing trustworthy consensus answers and
highly decisive reasoning chains, the COMPASS systematically enhances the
model's analytical capabilities. Extensive experiments show that COMPASS
achieves significant and consistent performance gains across diverse reasoning
tasks and model architectures, advancing a more scalable direction for LLMs to
learn from continuous experience.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Reliable verifiable data has become a key driver of capability gains in
modern language models, enabling stable reinforcement learning with verifiable
rewards and effective distillation that transfers competence across math,
coding, and agentic tasks. Yet constructing generalizable synthetic verifiable
data remains difficult due to hallucination-prone generation, and weak or
trivial verification artifacts that fail to separate strong from weak
solutions. Existing approaches often rely on task-specific heuristics or
post-hoc filters that do not transfer across domains and lack a principled,
universal evaluator of verifiability. In this work, we introduce an
evolutionary, task-agnostic, strategy-guided, executably-checkable data
synthesis framework that, from minimal seed supervision, jointly synthesizes
problems, diverse candidate solutions, and verification artifacts, and
iteratively discovers strategies via a consistency-based evaluator that
enforces agreement between human-annotated and strategy-induced checks. This
pipeline upgrades filtering into principled synthesis: it reliably assembles
coherent, verifiable training instances and generalizes without domain-specific
rules. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach
under both RLVR and model distillation training paradigms. The results show
that training with our synthesized data yields significant improvements on both
the LiveCodeBench and AgentBench-OS tasks, highlighting the robust
generalization of our framework.

Abstract: Detecting regime shifts in chaotic time series is hard because
observation-space signals are entangled with intrinsic variability. We propose
Parameter--Space Changepoint Detection (Param--CPD), a two--stage framework
that first amortizes Bayesian inference of governing parameters with a neural
posterior estimator trained by simulation-based inference, and then applies a
standard CPD algorithm to the resulting parameter trajectory. On Lorenz--63
with piecewise-constant parameters, Param--CPD improves F1, reduces
localization error, and lowers false positives compared to observation--space
baselines. We further verify identifiability and calibration of the inferred
posteriors on stationary trajectories, explaining why parameter space offers a
cleaner detection signal. Robustness analyses over tolerance, window length,
and noise indicate consistent gains. Our results show that operating in a
physically interpretable parameter space enables accurate and interpretable
changepoint detection in nonlinear dynamical systems.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Flow Matching (FM) underpins many state-of-the-art generative models, yet
recent results indicate that Transition Matching (TM) can achieve higher
quality with fewer sampling steps. This work answers the question of when and
why TM outperforms FM. First, when the target is a unimodal Gaussian
distribution, we prove that TM attains strictly lower KL divergence than FM for
finite number of steps. The improvement arises from stochastic difference
latent updates in TM, which preserve target covariance that deterministic FM
underestimates. We then characterize convergence rates, showing that TM
achieves faster convergence than FM under a fixed compute budget, establishing
its advantage in the unimodal Gaussian setting. Second, we extend the analysis
to Gaussian mixtures and identify local-unimodality regimes in which the
sampling dynamics approximate the unimodal case, where TM can outperform FM.
The approximation error decreases as the minimal distance between component
means increases, highlighting that TM is favored when the modes are well
separated. However, when the target variance approaches zero, each TM update
converges to the FM update, and the performance advantage of TM diminishes. In
summary, we show that TM outperforms FM when the target distribution has
well-separated modes and non-negligible variances. We validate our theoretical
results with controlled experiments on Gaussian distributions, and extend the
comparison to real-world applications in image and video generation.

Abstract: Deep subspace clustering models are vital for applications such as snowmelt
detection, sea ice tracking, crop health monitoring, infectious disease
modeling, network load prediction, and land-use planning, where multivariate
spatiotemporal data exhibit complex temporal dependencies and reside on
multiple nonlinear manifolds beyond the capability of traditional clustering
methods. These models project data into a latent space where samples lie in
linear subspaces and exploit the self-expressiveness property to uncover
intrinsic relationships. Despite their success, existing methods face major
limitations: they use shallow autoencoders that ignore clustering errors,
emphasize global features while neglecting local structure, fail to model
long-range dependencies and positional information, and are rarely applied to
4D spatiotemporal data. To address these issues, we propose A-DATSC
(Attention-Guided Deep Adversarial Temporal Subspace Clustering), a model
combining a deep subspace clustering generator and a quality-verifying
discriminator. The generator, inspired by U-Net, preserves spatial and temporal
integrity through stacked TimeDistributed ConvLSTM2D layers, reducing
parameters and enhancing generalization. A graph attention transformer based
self-expressive network captures local spatial relationships, global
dependencies, and both short- and long-range correlations. Experiments on three
real-world multivariate spatiotemporal datasets show that A-DATSC achieves
substantially superior clustering performance compared to state-of-the-art deep
subspace clustering models.

Abstract: Neural activity forecasting is central to understanding neural systems and

state-of-the-art in the time series forecasting literature, its application to
neural activity forecasting remains limited. To bridge this gap, we
systematically evaluated eight probabilistic deep learning models, including
two foundation models, that have demonstrated strong performance on general
forecasting benchmarks. We compared them against four classical statistical
models and two baseline methods on spontaneous neural activity recorded from
mouse cortex via widefield imaging. Across prediction horizons, several deep
learning models consistently outperformed classical approaches, with the best
model producing informative forecasts up to 1.5 seconds into the future. Our
findings point toward future control applications and open new avenues for
probing the intrinsic temporal structure of neural activity.

Abstract: Forecasting unobservable physical quantities from sparse, cross-domain sensor
data is a central unsolved problem in scientific machine learning. Existing
neural operators and large-scale forecasters rely on dense, co-located
input-output fields and short temporal contexts, assumptions that fail in
real-world systems where sensing and prediction occur on distinct physical
manifolds and over long timescales. We introduce the Spatio-Temporal Operator
Network (STONe), a non-autoregressive neural operator that learns a stable
functional mapping between heterogeneous domains. By directly inferring
high-altitude radiation dose fields from sparse ground-based neutron
measurements, STONe demonstrates that operator learning can generalize beyond
shared-domain settings. It defines a nonlinear operator between sensor and
target manifolds that remains stable over long forecasting horizons without
iterative recurrence. This challenges the conventional view that operator
learning requires domain alignment or autoregressive propagation. Trained on 23
years of global neutron data, STONe achieves accurate 180-day forecasts with
millisecond inference latency. The framework establishes a general principle
for cross-domain operator inference, enabling real-time prediction of complex
spatiotemporal fields in physics, climate, and energy systems.

Abstract: Causal representation learning in the anti-causal setting (labels cause
features rather than the reverse) presents unique challenges requiring
specialized approaches. We propose Anti-Causal Invariant Abstractions (ACIA), a
novel measure-theoretic framework for anti-causal representation learning. ACIA
employs a two-level design, low-level representations capture how labels
generate observations, while high-level representations learn stable causal
patterns across environment-specific variations. ACIA addresses key limitations
of existing approaches by accommodating prefect and imperfect interventions
through interventional kernels, eliminating dependency on explicit causal
structures, handling high-dimensional data effectively, and providing
theoretical guarantees for out-of-distribution generalization. Experiments on
synthetic and real-world medical datasets demonstrate that ACIA consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and invariance metrics.
Furthermore, our theoretical results establish tight bounds on performance gaps
between training and unseen environments, confirming the efficacy of our
approach for robust anti-causal learning.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Balancing exploration and exploitation during reinforcement learning
fine-tuning of generative models presents a critical challenge, as existing
approaches rely on fixed divergence regularization that creates an inherent
dilemma: strong regularization preserves model capabilities but limits reward
optimization, while weak regularization enables greater alignment but risks
instability or reward hacking. We introduce Adaptive Divergence Regularized
Policy Optimization (ADRPO), which automatically adjusts regularization
strength based on advantage estimates-reducing regularization for high-value
samples while applying stronger regularization to poor samples, enabling
policies to navigate between exploration and aggressive exploitation according
to data quality. Our implementation with Wasserstein-2 regularization for flow
matching generative models achieves remarkable results on text-to-image
generation, achieving better semantic alignment and diversity than offline
methods like DPO and online methods with fixed regularization like ORW-CFM-W2.
ADRPO enables a 2B parameter SD3 model to surpass much larger models with 4.8B
and 12B parameters in attribute binding, semantic consistency, artistic style
transfer, and compositional control while maintaining generation diversity.
ADRPO generalizes to KL-regularized fine-tuning of both text-only LLMs and
multi-modal reasoning models, enhancing existing online RL methods like GRPO.
In LLM fine-tuning, ADRPO demonstrates an emergent ability to escape local
optima through active exploration, while in multi-modal audio reasoning, it
outperforms GRPO through superior step-by-step reasoning, enabling a 7B model
to outperform substantially larger commercial models including Gemini 2.5 Pro
and GPT-4o Audio, offering an effective plug-and-play solution to the
exploration-exploitation challenge across diverse generative architectures and
modalities.

Abstract: Developing autonomous vehicles (AVs) requires not only safety and efficiency,
but also realistic, human-like behaviors that are socially aware and
predictable. Achieving this requires sim agent policies that are human-like,
fast, and scalable in multi-agent settings. Recent progress in imitation
learning with large diffusion-based or tokenized models has shown that
behaviors can be captured directly from human driving data, producing realistic
policies. However, these models are computationally expensive, slow during
inference, and struggle to adapt in reactive, closed-loop scenarios. In
contrast, self-play reinforcement learning (RL) scales efficiently and
naturally captures multi-agent interactions, but it often relies on heuristics
and reward shaping, and the resulting policies can diverge from human norms. We
propose SPACeR, a framework that leverages a pretrained tokenized
autoregressive motion model as a centralized reference policy to guide
decentralized self-play. The reference model provides likelihood rewards and KL
divergence, anchoring policies to the human driving distribution while
preserving RL scalability. Evaluated on the Waymo Sim Agents Challenge, our
method achieves competitive performance with imitation-learned policies while
being up to 10x faster at inference and 50x smaller in parameter size than
large generative models. In addition, we demonstrate in closed-loop ego
planning evaluation tasks that our sim agents can effectively measure planner
quality with fast and scalable traffic simulation, establishing a new paradigm
for testing autonomous driving policies.

Abstract: Flow-based generative models have shown remarkable success in text-to-image
generation, yet fine-tuning them with intermediate feedback remains
challenging, especially for continuous-time flow matching models. Most existing
approaches solely learn from outcome rewards, struggling with the credit
assignment problem. Alternative methods that attempt to learn a critic via
direct regression on cumulative rewards often face training instabilities and
model collapse in online settings. We present AC-Flow, a robust actor-critic
framework that addresses these challenges through three key innovations: (1)
reward shaping that provides well-normalized learning signals to enable stable
intermediate value learning and gradient control, (2) a novel dual-stability
mechanism that combines advantage clipping to prevent destructive policy
updates with a warm-up phase that allows the critic to mature before
influencing the actor, and (3) a scalable generalized critic weighting scheme
that extends traditional reward-weighted methods while preserving model
diversity through Wasserstein regularization. Through extensive experiments on
Stable Diffusion 3, we demonstrate that AC-Flow achieves state-of-the-art
performance in text-to-image alignment tasks and generalization to unseen human
preference models. Our results demonstrate that even with a computationally
efficient critic model, we can robustly finetune flow models without
compromising generative quality, diversity, or stability.

Abstract: In this work, we address the problem of determining reliable policies in
reinforcement learning (RL), with a focus on optimization under uncertainty and
the need for performance guarantees. While classical RL algorithms aim at
maximizing the expected return, many real-world applications - such as routing,
resource allocation, or sequential decision-making under risk - require
strategies that ensure not only high average performance but also a guaranteed
probability of success. To this end, we propose a novel formulation in which
the objective is to maximize the probability that the cumulative return exceeds
a prescribed threshold. We demonstrate that this reliable RL problem can be
reformulated, via a state-augmented representation, into a standard RL problem,
thereby allowing the use of existing RL and deep RL algorithms without the need
for entirely new algorithmic frameworks. Theoretical results establish the
equivalence of the two formulations and show that reliable strategies can be
derived by appropriately adapting well-known methods such as Q-learning or
Dueling Double DQN. To illustrate the practical relevance of the approach, we
consider the problem of reliable routing, where the goal is not to minimize the
expected travel time but rather to maximize the probability of reaching the
destination within a given time budget. Numerical experiments confirm that the
proposed formulation leads to policies that effectively balance efficiency and
reliability, highlighting the potential of reliable RL for applications in
stochastic and safety-critical environments.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) holds great potential to advance anomaly detection (AD)

by the lack of openly available experimental data. To address this gap, we have
set up a laboratory-scale batch distillation plant and operated it to generate
an extensive experimental database, covering fault-free experiments and
experiments in which anomalies were intentionally induced, for training
advanced ML-based AD methods. In total, 119 experiments were conducted across a
wide range of operating conditions and mixtures. Most experiments containing
anomalies were paired with a corresponding fault-free one. The database that we
provide here includes time-series data from numerous sensors and actuators,
along with estimates of measurement uncertainty. In addition, unconventional
data sources -- such as concentration profiles obtained via online benchtop NMR
spectroscopy and video and audio recordings -- are provided. Extensive metadata
and expert annotations of all experiments are included. The anomaly annotations
are based on an ontology developed in this work. The data are organized in a

development of advanced ML-based AD methods. As it includes information on the
causes of anomalies, it further enables the development of interpretable and

Abstract: Modelling the complex spatiotemporal patterns of large-scale brain dynamics
is crucial for neuroscience, but traditional methods fail to capture the rich
structure in modalities such as magnetoencephalography (MEG). Recent advances
in deep learning have enabled significant progress in other domains, such as
language and vision, by using foundation models at scale. Here, we introduce
MEG-GPT, a transformer based foundation model that uses time-attention and next
time-point prediction. To facilitate this, we also introduce a novel
data-driven tokeniser for continuous MEG data, which preserves the high
temporal resolution of continuous MEG signals without lossy transformations. We
trained MEG-GPT on tokenised brain region time-courses extracted from a
large-scale MEG dataset (N=612, eyes-closed rest, Cam-CAN data), and show that
the learnt model can generate data with realistic spatio-spectral properties,
including transient events and population variability. Critically, it performs
well in downstream decoding tasks, improving downstream supervised prediction
task, showing improved zero-shot generalisation across sessions (improving

efficiently fine-tuned on a smaller labelled dataset to boost performance in

model for electrophysiological data, paving the way for applications in

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong but shallow alignment: they
directly refuse harmful queries when a refusal is expected at the very start of
an assistant turn, yet this protection collapses once a harmful continuation is
underway (either through the adversarial attacks or via harmful
assistant-prefill attacks). This raises a fundamental question: Can the innate
shallow alignment in LLMs be unlocked to ensure safety at arbitrary generation
depths? To achieve this goal, we propose Any-Depth Alignment (ADA), an
effective inference-time defense with negligible overhead. ADA is built based
on our observation that alignment is concentrated in the assistant header
tokens through repeated use in shallow-refusal training, and these tokens
possess the model's strong alignment priors. By reintroducing these tokens
mid-stream, ADA induces the model to reassess harmfulness and recover refusals
at any point in generation. Across diverse open-source model families (Llama,
Gemma, Mistral, Qwen, DeepSeek, and gpt-oss), ADA achieves robust safety
performance without requiring any changes to the base model's parameters. It
secures a near-100% refusal rate against challenging adversarial prefill
attacks ranging from dozens to thousands of tokens. Furthermore, ADA reduces
the average success rate of prominent adversarial prompt attacks (such as GCG,
AutoDAN, PAIR, and TAP) to below 3%. This is all accomplished while preserving
utility on benign tasks with minimal over-refusal. ADA maintains this
resilience even after the base model undergoes subsequent instruction tuning
(benign or adversarial).

Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) enable its use on increasingly
complex tasks, but the lack of formal safety guarantees still limits its
application in safety-critical settings. A common practical approach is to
augment the RL policy with a safety filter that overrides unsafe actions to
prevent failures during both training and deployment. However, safety filtering
is often perceived as sacrificing performance and hindering the learning
process. We show that this perceived safety-performance tradeoff is not
inherent and prove, for the first time, that enforcing safety with a
sufficiently permissive safety filter does not degrade asymptotic performance.
We formalize RL safety with a safety-critical Markov decision process (SC-MDP),
which requires categorical, rather than high-probability, avoidance of
catastrophic failure states. Additionally, we define an associated filtered MDP
in which all actions result in safe effects, thanks to a safety filter that is
considered to be a part of the environment. Our main theorem establishes that
(i) learning in the filtered MDP is safe categorically, (ii) standard RL
convergence carries over to the filtered MDP, and (iii) any policy that is
optimal in the filtered MDP-when executed through the same filter-achieves the
same asymptotic return as the best safe policy in the SC-MDP, yielding a
complete separation between safety enforcement and performance optimization. We
validate the theory on Safety Gymnasium with representative tasks and
constraints, observing zero violations during training and final performance
matching or exceeding unfiltered baselines. Together, these results shed light
on a long-standing question in safety-filtered learning and provide a simple,
principled recipe for safe RL: train and deploy RL policies with the most
permissive safety filter that is available.

Abstract: Accurate early prediction of in-hospital mortality in intensive care units
(ICUs) is essential for timely clinical intervention and efficient resource
allocation. This study develops and evaluates machine learning models that
integrate both structured clinical data and unstructured textual information,
specifically discharge summaries and radiology reports, from the MIMIC-IV
database. We used LASSO and XGBoost for feature selection, followed by a
multivariate logistic regression trained on the top features identified by both
models. Incorporating textual features using TF-IDF and BERT embeddings
significantly improved predictive performance. The final logistic regression
model, which combined structured and textual input, achieved an AUC of 0.918,
compared to 0.753 when using structured data alone, a relative improvement 22%.
The analysis of the decision curve demonstrated a superior standardized net
benefit in a wide range of threshold probabilities (0.2-0.8), confirming the
clinical utility of the model. These results underscore the added prognostic
value of unstructured clinical notes and support their integration into
interpretable feature-driven risk prediction models for ICU patients.

Abstract: We study discrete diffusion for language and other categorical data and focus
on a common limitation of masked denoisers: reverse transitions typically
factorize across positions, which can weaken joint structure and degrade
quality in few-step generation. We propose \emph{Latent Discrete Diffusion
Models} (LDDMs), which couple a masked discrete diffusion over tokens with a
continuous diffusion over latent embeddings. The latent channel provides a
softer signal and carries cross-token dependencies that help resolve
ambiguities. We present two instantiations: (i) FUJI-LDDMs, which perform fully
joint denoising of tokens and latents, and (ii) SEQ-LDDMs, which sequentially
resolve the latent and then the discrete chain conditionally on it. For both
variants we derive ELBO-style objectives and discuss design choices to learn
informative latents yet amenable to diffusoin modeling. In experiments, LDDMs
yield improvements on unconditional generation metrics as compared to
state-of-the-art masked discrete diffusion baselines, and are effective at
lower sampling budgets, where unmasking many tokens per step is desirable.

Abstract: Rectified Flows learn ODE vector fields whose trajectories are straight
between source and target distributions, enabling near one-step inference. We
show that this straight-path objective conceals fundamental failure modes:
under deterministic training, low gradient variance drives memorization of
arbitrary training pairings, even when interpolant lines between pairs
intersect. To analyze this mechanism, we study Gaussian-to-Gaussian transport
and use the loss gradient variance across stochastic and deterministic regimes
to characterize which vector fields optimization favors in each setting. We
then show that, in a setting where all interpolating lines intersect, applying
Rectified Flow yields the same specific pairings at inference as during
training. More generally, we prove that a memorizing vector field exists even
when training interpolants intersect, and that optimizing the straight-path
objective converges to this ill-defined field. At inference, deterministic
integration reproduces the exact training pairings. We validate our findings
empirically on the CelebA dataset, confirming that deterministic interpolants
induce memorization, while the injection of small noise restores
generalization.

Abstract: We introduce HyperDiffusionFields (HyDiF), a framework that models 3D
molecular conformers as continuous fields rather than discrete atomic
coordinates or graphs. At the core of our approach is the Molecular Directional
Field (MDF), a vector field that maps any point in space to the direction of
the nearest atom of a particular type. We represent MDFs using
molecule-specific neural implicit fields, which we call Molecular Neural Fields
(MNFs). To enable learning across molecules and facilitate generalization, we
adopt an approach where a shared hypernetwork, conditioned on a molecule,
generates the weights of the given molecule's MNF. To endow the model with
generative capabilities, we train the hypernetwork as a denoising diffusion
model, enabling sampling in the function space of molecular fields. Our design
naturally extends to a masked diffusion mechanism to support
structure-conditioned generation tasks, such as molecular inpainting, by
selectively noising regions of the field. Beyond generation, the localized and
continuous nature of MDFs enables spatially fine-grained feature extraction for
molecular property prediction, something not easily achievable with graph or
point cloud based methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our approach scales
to larger biomolecules, illustrating a promising direction for field-based
molecular modeling.

Abstract: Motivated by the recently shown connection between self-attention and

PCA. Using the difference-of-convex (DC) framework, we present several novel
formulations and provide new theoretical insights. In particular, we show the
kernelizability and out-of-sample applicability for a PCA-like family of
problems. Moreover, we uncover that simultaneous iteration, which is connected
to the classical QR algorithm, is an instance of the difference-of-convex
algorithm (DCA), offering an optimization perspective on this longstanding
method. Further, we describe new algorithms for PCA and empirically compare
them with state-of-the-art methods. Lastly, we introduce a kernelizable dual
formulation for a robust variant of PCA that minimizes the $l_1$ deviation of
the reconstruction errors.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at generating fluent text, but their
internal reasoning remains opaque and difficult to control. Sparse autoencoders
(SAEs) make hidden activations more interpretable by exposing latent features
that often align with human concepts. Yet, these features are fragile and
passive, offering no mechanism for systematic reasoning or model control. To
address this, we introduce ActivationReasoning (AR), a framework that embeds
explicit logical reasoning into the latent space of LLMs. It proceeds in three
stages: (1) Finding latent representations, first latent concept
representations are identified (e.g., via SAEs) and organized into a
dictionary; (2) Activating propositions, at inference time AR detects
activating concepts and maps them to logical propositions; and (3)Logical
reasoning, applying logical rules over these propositions to infer higher-order
structures, compose new concepts, and steer model behavior. We evaluate AR on
multi-hop reasoning (PrOntoQA), abstraction and robustness to indirect concept
cues (Rail2Country), reasoning over natural and diverse language (ProverQA),
and context-sensitive safety (BeaverTails). Across all tasks, AR scales
robustly with reasoning complexity, generalizes to abstract and
context-sensitive tasks, and transfers across model backbones. These results
demonstrate that grounding logical structure in latent activations not only
improves transparency but also enables structured reasoning, reliable control,
and alignment with desired behaviors, providing a path toward more reliable and
auditable AI.

Abstract: The objective of designing a control system is to steer a dynamical system
with a control signal, guiding it to exhibit the desired behavior. The
Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) partial differential equation offers a framework
for optimal control system design. However, numerical solutions to this
equation are computationally intensive, and analytical solutions are frequently
unavailable. Knowledge-guided machine learning methodologies, such as
physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), offer new alternative approaches that
can alleviate the difficulties of solving the HJB equation numerically. This
work presents a multistage ensemble framework to learn the optimal cost-to-go,
and subsequently the corresponding optimal control signal, through the HJB
equation. Prior PINN-based approaches rely on a stabilizing the HJB enforcement
during training. Our framework does not use stabilizer terms and offers a means
of controlling the nonlinear system, via either a singular learned control
signal or an ensemble control signal policy. Success is demonstrated in
closed-loop control, using both ensemble- and singular-control, of a
steady-state time-invariant two-state continuous nonlinear system with an
infinite time horizon, accounting of noisy, perturbed system states and varying
initial conditions.

Abstract: This paper investigates underwater cooperative target detection using
autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), with a focus on the critical trade-off
between cooperation efficiency and communication covertness. To tackle this
challenge, we first formulate a joint trajectory and power control optimization
problem, and then present an innovative hierarchical action management
framework to solve it. According to the hierarchical formulation, at the macro
level, the master AUV models the agent selection process as a Markov decision
process and deploys the proximal policy optimization algorithm for strategic
task allocation. At the micro level, each selected agent's decentralized
decision-making is modeled as a partially observable Markov decision process,
and a multi-agent proximal policy optimization algorithm is used to dynamically
adjust its trajectory and transmission power based on its local observations.
Under the centralized training and decentralized execution paradigm, our target
detection framework enables adaptive covert cooperation while satisfying both
energy and mobility constraints. By comprehensively modeling the considered
system, the involved signals and tasks, as well as energy consumption,
theoretical insights and practical solutions for the efficient and secure
operation of multiple AUVs are provided, offering significant implications for
the execution of underwater covert communication tasks.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) using zeroth-order (ZO) optimization
has emerged as a promising alternative to traditional gradient-based methods
due to its reduced memory footprint requirement. However, existing ZO methods
suffer from high variance in gradient estimation, leading to slow convergence
and suboptimal performance on large-scale models. In this work, we propose
P-GAP, a fast LLM fine-tuning approach through zeroth-order optimization with
Projected Gradient-Aligned Perturbations. Specifically, we first estimate a
low-dimensional gradient space and then align perturbations in projected
gradients' direction within the space. This approach enables reduced the number
of perturbed parameters and decreased variance, therefore accelerated
convergence for LLM fine-tuning. Experiments on LLMs show that P-GAP
consistently surpasses the baselines, achieving up to 6% increase in accuracy
on classification tasks and up to 12% higher accuracy on generation tasks, with
up to about 81% less training iterations and 70% less GPU hours. These results
demonstrate that P-GAP enables fast, scalable, and resource-efficient ZO LLM
fine-tuning.

Abstract: Generating high-quality synthetic text under differential privacy (DP) is
critical for training and evaluating language models without compromising user
privacy. Prior work on synthesizing DP datasets often fail to preserve key
statistical attributes, suffer utility loss from the noise required by DP, and
lack fine-grained control over generation. To address these challenges, we make
two contributions. First, we introduce a hierarchical framework that decomposes
DP synthetic text generation into two subtasks: feature learning and
conditional text generation. This design explicitly incorporates learned
features into the generation process and simplifies the end-to-end synthesis
task. Through systematic ablations, we identify the most effective
configuration: a rich tabular schema as feature, a DP tabular synthesizer, and
a DP fine-tuned conditional generator, which we term ACTG
(Attribute-Conditioned Text Generation). Second, we propose Anchored RL (ARL),
a post-training method that improves the instruction-following ability of ACTG
for conditional generation. ARL combines RL to boost control with an SFT anchor
on best-of-$N$ data to prevent reward hacking. Together, these components form
our end-to-end algorithm ACTG-ARL, which advances both the quality of DP
synthetic text (+20% MAUVE over prior work) and the control of the conditional
generator under strong privacy guarantees.

concretely recognize projects that simultaneously achieve deployment and novel
ML methodological innovation. We argue that this introduces incentives for
researchers that undermine the sustainability of a broader research ecosystem
of social impact, which benefits from projects that make contributions on
single front (applied or methodological) that may better meet project partner
needs. Our position is that researchers and reviewers in machine learning for
social impact must simultaneously adopt: 1) a more expansive conception of
social impacts beyond deployment and 2) more rigorous evaluations of the impact

Abstract: Multi-modal entity alignment (MMEA) aims to identify equivalent entities
across heterogeneous multi-modal knowledge graphs (MMKGs), where each entity is
described by attributes from various modalities. Existing methods typically
assume that both intra-entity and inter-graph correspondences are faultless,
which is often violated in real-world MMKGs due to the reliance on expert
annotations. In this paper, we reveal and study a highly practical yet
under-explored problem in MMEA, termed Dual-level Noisy Correspondence (DNC).
DNC refers to misalignments in both intra-entity (entity-attribute) and
inter-graph (entity-entity and attribute-attribute) correspondences. To address
the DNC problem, we propose a robust MMEA framework termed RULE. RULE first
estimates the reliability of both intra-entity and inter-graph correspondences
via a dedicated two-fold principle. Leveraging the estimated reliabilities,
RULE mitigates the negative impact of intra-entity noise during attribute
fusion and prevents overfitting to noisy inter-graph correspondences during
inter-graph discrepancy elimination. Beyond the training-time designs, RULE
further incorporates a correspondence reasoning module that uncovers the
underlying attribute-attribute connection across graphs, guaranteeing more
accurate equivalent entity identification. Extensive experiments on five
benchmarks verify the effectiveness of our method against the DNC compared with
seven state-of-the-art methods.The code is available at

Abstract: Scaling the number of parameters and the size of training data has proven to
be an effective strategy for improving large language model (LLM) performance.
Yet, as these models grow increasingly powerful and widely deployed, the cost
of inference has become a pressing concern. Despite its importance, the
trade-off between model accuracy and inference efficiency remains
underexplored. In this work, we examine how key architectural factors, hidden
size, the allocation of parameters between MLP and attention (mlp-to-attention
ratio), and grouped-query attention (GQA), influence both inference cost and
accuracy. We introduce a conditional scaling law that augments the Chinchilla
framework with architectural information, along with a search framework for
identifying architectures that are simultaneously inference-efficient and
accurate. To validate our approach, we train more than 200 models spanning 80M
to 3B parameters and 8B to 100B training tokens, and fit the proposed
conditional scaling law. Our results show that the conditional scaling law
reliably predicts optimal architectural choices and that the resulting models
outperform existing open-source baselines. Under the same training budget,
optimized architectures achieve up to 2.1% higher accuracy and 42% greater
inference throughput compared to LLaMA-3.2.

Abstract: Multi-Task Learning (MTL) enables a single model to learn multiple tasks
simultaneously, leveraging knowledge transfer among tasks for enhanced
generalization, and has been widely applied across various domains. However,
task imbalance remains a major challenge in MTL. Although balancing the
convergence speeds of different tasks is an effective approach to address this
issue, it is highly challenging to accurately characterize the training
dynamics and convergence speeds of multiple tasks within the complex MTL
system. To this end, we attempt to analyze the training dynamics in MTL by
leveraging Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) theory and propose a new MTL method,
NTKMTL. Specifically, we introduce an extended NTK matrix for MTL and adopt
spectral analysis to balance the convergence speeds of multiple tasks, thereby
mitigating task imbalance. Based on the approximation via shared
representation, we further propose NTKMTL-SR, achieving training efficiency
while maintaining competitive performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our methods achieve state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of
benchmarks, including both multi-task supervised learning and multi-task
reinforcement learning. Source code is available at

Abstract: Subject-driven image generation models face a fundamental trade-off between
identity preservation (fidelity) and prompt adherence (editability). While
online reinforcement learning (RL), specifically GPRO, offers a promising
solution, we find that a naive application of GRPO leads to competitive
degradation, as the simple linear aggregation of rewards with static weights
causes conflicting gradient signals and a misalignment with the temporal
dynamics of the diffusion process. To overcome these limitations, we propose
Customized-GRPO, a novel framework featuring two key innovations: (i)
Synergy-Aware Reward Shaping (SARS), a non-linear mechanism that explicitly
penalizes conflicted reward signals and amplifies synergistic ones, providing a
sharper and more decisive gradient. (ii) Time-Aware Dynamic Weighting (TDW),
which aligns the optimization pressure with the model's temporal dynamics by
prioritizing prompt-following in the early, identity preservation in the later.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms
naive GRPO baselines, successfully mitigating competitive degradation. Our
model achieves a superior balance, generating images that both preserve key
identity features and accurately adhere to complex textual prompts.

Abstract: This paper is concerned with online time series forecasting, where unknown
distribution shifts occur over time, i.e., latent variables influence the
mapping from historical to future observations. To develop an automated way of
online time series forecasting, we propose a Theoretical framework for Online
Time-series forecasting (TOT in short) with theoretical guarantees.
Specifically, we prove that supplying a forecaster with latent variables
tightens the Bayes risk, the benefit endures under estimation uncertainty of
latent variables and grows as the latent variables achieve a more precise
identifiability. To better introduce latent variables into online forecasting
algorithms, we further propose to identify latent variables with minimal
adjacent observations. Based on these results, we devise a model-agnostic
blueprint by employing a temporal decoder to match the distribution of observed
variables and two independent noise estimators to model the causal inference of
latent variables and mixing procedures of observed variables, respectively.
Experiment results on synthetic data support our theoretical claims. Moreover,
plug-in implementations built on several baselines yield general improvement
across multiple benchmarks, highlighting the effectiveness in real-world
applications.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: In millimeter wave (mmWave) communications, beam alignment and tracking are
crucial to combat the significant path loss. As scanning the entire directional
space is inefficient, designing an efficient and robust method to identify the
optimal beam directions is essential. Since traditional bandit algorithms
require a long time horizon to converge under large beam spaces, many existing
works propose efficient bandit algorithms for beam alignment by relying on
unimodality or multimodality assumptions on the reward function's structure.
However, such assumptions often do not hold (or cannot be strictly satisfied)
in practice, which causes such algorithms to converge to choosing suboptimal
beams.
  In this work, we propose two physics-informed bandit algorithms
\textit{pretc} and \textit{prgreedy} that exploit the sparse multipath property
of mmWave channels - a generic but realistic assumption - which is connected to
the Phase Retrieval Bandit problem. Our algorithms treat the parameters of each
path as black boxes and maintain optimal estimates of them based on sampled
historical rewards. \textit{pretc} starts with a random exploration phase and
then commits to the optimal beam under the estimated reward function.
\textit{prgreedy} performs such estimation in an online manner and chooses the
best beam under current estimates. Our algorithms can also be easily adapted to
beam tracking in the mobile setting. Through experiments using both the
synthetic DeepMIMO dataset and the real-world DeepSense6G dataset, we
demonstrate that both algorithms outperform existing approaches in a wide range
of scenarios across diverse channel environments, showing their
generalizability and robustness.

methods fail to capture such dynamics, as they fail to recover the joint
distribution of hierarchical latent variables from \textit{single-timestep
observed variables}. Interestingly, we find that the joint distribution of
hierarchical latent variables can be uniquely determined using three
conditionally independent observations. Building on this insight, we propose a
Causally Hierarchical Latent Dynamic (CHiLD) identification framework. Our
approach first employs temporal contextual observed variables to identify the
joint distribution of multi-layer latent variables. Sequentially, we exploit
the natural sparsity of the hierarchical structure among latent variables to
identify latent variables within each layer. Guided by the theoretical results,
we develop a time series generative model grounded in variational inference.
This model incorporates a contextual encoder to reconstruct multi-layer latent
variables and normalize flow-based hierarchical prior networks to impose the
independent noise condition of hierarchical latent dynamics. Empirical
evaluations on both synthetic and real-world datasets validate our theoretical
claims and demonstrate the effectiveness of CHiLD in modeling hierarchical
latent dynamics.

Abstract: We investigate how embedding dimension affects the emergence of an internal
"world model" in a transformer trained with reinforcement learning to perform
bubble-sort-style adjacent swaps. Models achieve high accuracy even with very
small embedding dimensions, but larger dimensions yield more faithful,
consistent, and robust internal representations. In particular, higher
embedding dimensions strengthen the formation of structured internal
representation and lead to better interpretability. After hundreds of
experiments, we observe two consistent mechanisms: (1) the last row of the
attention weight matrix monotonically encodes the global ordering of tokens;
and (2) the selected transposition aligns with the largest adjacent difference
of these encoded values. Our results provide quantitative evidence that
transformers build structured internal world models and that model size
improves representation quality in addition to end performance. We release our
metrics and analyses, which can be used to probe similar algorithmic tasks.

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification (UQ) is crucial for deploying machine learning
models in high-stakes applications, where overconfident predictions can lead to
serious consequences. An effective UQ method must balance computational
efficiency with the ability to generalize across diverse scenarios. Evidential
deep learning (EDL) achieves efficiency by modeling uncertainty through the
prediction of a Dirichlet distribution over class probabilities. However, the
restrictive assumption of Dirichlet-distributed class probabilities limits
EDL's robustness, particularly in complex or unforeseen situations. To address
this, we propose \textit{flexible evidential deep learning}
($\mathcal{F}$-EDL), which extends EDL by predicting a flexible Dirichlet
distribution -- a generalization of the Dirichlet distribution -- over class
probabilities. This approach provides a more expressive and adaptive
representation of uncertainty, significantly enhancing UQ generalization and
reliability under challenging scenarios. We theoretically establish several
advantages of $\mathcal{F}$-EDL and empirically demonstrate its
state-of-the-art UQ performance across diverse evaluation settings, including
classical, long-tailed, and noisy in-distribution scenarios.

Abstract: We introduce Time-Conditioned Contraction Matching (TCCM), a novel method for
semi-supervised anomaly detection in tabular data. TCCM is inspired by flow
matching, a recent generative modeling framework that learns velocity fields
between probability distributions and has shown strong performance compared to
diffusion models and generative adversarial networks. Instead of directly
applying flow matching as originally formulated, TCCM builds on its core idea
-- learning velocity fields between distributions -- but simplifies the
framework by predicting a time-conditioned contraction vector toward a fixed
target (the origin) at each sampled time step. This design offers three key
advantages: (1) a lightweight and scalable training objective that removes the
need for solving ordinary differential equations during training and inference;
(2) an efficient scoring strategy called one time-step deviation, which
quantifies deviation from expected contraction behavior in a single forward
pass, addressing the inference bottleneck of existing continuous-time models
such as DTE (a diffusion-based model with leading anomaly detection accuracy
but heavy inference cost); and (3) explainability and provable robustness, as
the learned velocity field operates directly in input space, making the anomaly
score inherently feature-wise attributable; moreover, the score function is
Lipschitz-continuous with respect to the input, providing theoretical
guarantees under small perturbations. Extensive experiments on the ADBench
benchmark show that TCCM strikes a favorable balance between detection accuracy
and inference cost, outperforming state-of-the-art methods -- especially on
high-dimensional and large-scale datasets. The source code is available at our
GitHub repository.

Abstract: The classical policy gradient method is the theoretical and conceptual
foundation of modern policy-based reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms. Most
rigorous analyses of such methods, particularly those establishing convergence
guarantees, assume a discount factor $\gamma < 1$. In contrast, however, a
recent line of work on policy-based RL for large language models uses the
undiscounted total-reward setting with $\gamma = 1$, rendering much of the
existing theory inapplicable. In this paper, we provide analyses of the policy
gradient method for undiscounted expected total-reward infinite-horizon MDPs
based on two key insights: (i) the classification of the MDP states into
recurrent and transient states is invariant over the set of policies that
assign strictly positive probability to every action (as is typical in deep RL
models employing a softmax output layer) and (ii) the classical state
visitation measure (which may be ill-defined when $\gamma = 1$) can be replaced
with a new object that we call the transient visitation measure.

Abstract: Understanding when learning is possible is a fundamental task in the theory
of machine learning. However, many characterizations known from the literature
deal with abstract learning as a mathematical object and ignore the crucial
question: when can learning be implemented as a computer program? We address
this question for universal online learning, a generalist theoretical model of
online binary classification, recently characterized by Bousquet et al.
(STOC'21). In this model, there is no hypothesis fixed in advance; instead,
Adversary -- playing the role of Nature -- can change their mind as long as
local consistency with the given class of hypotheses is maintained. We require
Learner to achieve a finite number of mistakes while using a strategy that can
be implemented as a computer program. We show that universal online learning
does not imply computable universal online learning, even if the class of
hypotheses is relatively easy from a computability-theoretic perspective. We
then study the agnostic variant of computable universal online learning and
provide an exact characterization of classes that are learnable in this sense.
We also consider a variant of proper universal online learning and show exactly
when it is possible. Together, our results give a more realistic perspective on
the existing theory of online binary classification and the related problem of
inductive inference.

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification (UQ) is essential for deploying deep neural
networks in safety-critical settings. Although methods like Deep Ensembles
achieve strong UQ performance, their high computational and memory costs hinder
scalability to large models. We introduce Hydra Ensembles, an efficient
transformer-based ensemble that prunes attention heads to create diverse
members and merges them via a new multi-head attention with grouped
fully-connected layers. This yields a compact model with inference speed close
to a single network, matching or surpassing Deep Ensembles in UQ performance
without retraining from scratch. We also provide an in-depth analysis of
pruning, showing that naive approaches can harm calibration, whereas Hydra
Ensembles preserves robust uncertainty. Experiments on image and text
classification tasks, with various architectures, show consistent gains over
Deep Ensembles. Remarkably, in zero-shot classification on ImageNet-1k, our
approach surpasses state of the art methods, even without requiring additional
training.

Abstract: The performance of a deep learning model on a specific task and dataset
depends heavily on its neural architecture, motivating considerable efforts to
rapidly and accurately identify architectures suited to the target task and
dataset. To achieve this, researchers use machine learning models-typically
neural architecture encoders-to predict the performance of a neural
architecture. Many state-of-the-art encoders aim to capture information flow
within a neural architecture, which reflects how information moves through the
forward pass and backpropagation, via a specialized model structure. However,
due to their complicated structures, these flow-based encoders are
significantly slower to process neural architectures compared to simpler
encoders, presenting a notable practical challenge. To address this, we propose
FGP, a novel pre-training method for neural architecture encoding that trains
an encoder to capture the information flow without requiring specialized model
structures. FGP trains an encoder to reconstruct a flow surrogate, our proposed
representation of the neural architecture's information flow. Our experiments
show that FGP boosts encoder performance by up to 106% in Precision-1%,
compared to the same encoder trained solely with supervised learning.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Unsupervised Graph Domain Adaptation has become a promising paradigm for
transferring knowledge from a fully labeled source graph to an unlabeled target
graph. Existing graph domain adaptation models primarily focus on the
closed-set setting, where the source and target domains share the same label
spaces. However, this assumption might not be practical in the real-world
scenarios, as the target domain might include classes that are not present in
the source domain. In this paper, we investigate the problem of unsupervised
open-set graph domain adaptation, where the goal is to not only correctly
classify target nodes into the known classes, but also recognize previously
unseen node types into the unknown class. Towards this end, we propose a novel
framework called GraphRTA, which conducts reprogramming on both the graph and
model sides. Specifically, we reprogram the graph by modifying target graph
structure and node features, which facilitates better separation of known and
unknown classes. Meanwhile, we also perform model reprogramming by pruning
domain-specific parameters to reduce bias towards the source graph while
preserving parameters that capture transferable patterns across graphs.
Additionally, we extend the classifier with an extra dimension for the unknown
class, thus eliminating the need of manually specified threshold in open-set
recognition. Comprehensive experiments on several public datasets demonstrate
that our proposed model can achieve satisfied performance compared with recent
state-of-the-art baselines. Our source codes and datasets are publicly
available at https://github.com/cszhangzhen/GraphRTA.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become essential tools for learning on
relational data, yet the performance of a single GNN is often limited by the
heterogeneity present in real-world graphs. Recent advances in
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) frameworks demonstrate that assembling multiple,
explicitly diverse GNNs with distinct generalization patterns can significantly
improve performance. In this work, we present the first systematic empirical
study of expert-level diversification techniques for GNN ensembles. Evaluating
20 diversification strategies -- including random re-initialization,
hyperparameter tuning, architectural variation, directionality modeling, and
training data partitioning -- across 14 node classification benchmarks, we
construct and analyze over 200 ensemble variants. Our comprehensive evaluation
examines each technique in terms of expert diversity, complementarity, and
ensemble performance. We also uncovers mechanistic insights into training
maximally diverse experts. These findings provide actionable guidance for
expert training and the design of effective MoE frameworks on graph data. Our

focuses on the dependence of the approximation rate on the dimension and the
smoothness of the function being approximated within the Barron function space.
We examine the approximation rates of ReLU$^{k}$ activation functions, proving
that the optimal rate cannot be achieved under $\ell^{1}$-bounded coefficients
or insufficient smoothness conditions.
  We also establish optimal approximation rates in various norms for functions
in Barron spaces and Sobolev spaces, confirming the curse of dimensionality.
Our results clarify the limits of shallow neural networks' approximation
capabilities and offer insights into the selection of activation functions and

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Weakly supervised learning often operates with coarse aggregate signals
rather than instance labels. We study a setting where each training example is
an $n$-tuple containing exactly m positives, while only the count m per tuple
is observed. This NTMP (N-tuple with M positives) supervision arises in, e.g.,
image classification with region proposals and multi-instance measurements. We
show that tuple counts admit a trainable unbiased risk estimator (URE) by
linking the tuple-generation process to latent instance marginals. Starting
from fixed (n,m), we derive a closed-form URE and extend it to variable tuple
sizes, variable counts, and their combination. Identification holds whenever
the effective mixing rate is separated from the class prior. We establish
generalization bounds via Rademacher complexity and prove statistical
consistency with standard rates under mild regularity assumptions. To improve
finite-sample stability, we introduce simple ReLU corrections to the URE that
preserve asymptotic correctness. Across benchmarks converted to NTMP tasks, the
approach consistently outperforms representative weak-supervision baselines and
yields favorable precision-recall and F1 trade-offs. It remains robust under
class-prior imbalance and across diverse tuple configurations, demonstrating
that count-only supervision can be exploited effectively through a
theoretically grounded and practically stable objective.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) achieve remarkable performance but often suffer
from overfitting due to their high capacity. We introduce Momentum-Adaptive
Gradient Dropout (MAGDrop), a novel regularization method that dynamically
adjusts dropout rates on activations based on current gradients and accumulated
momentum, enhancing stability in non-convex optimization landscapes. To
theoretically justify MAGDrop's effectiveness, we derive a tightened PAC-Bayes
generalization bound that accounts for its adaptive nature, achieving up to 20%
sharper bounds compared to standard approaches by leveraging momentum-driven
perturbation control. Empirically, the activation-based MAGDrop outperforms
baseline regularization techniques, including standard dropout and adaptive
gradient regularization, by 1-2% in test accuracy on MNIST (99.52%) and
CIFAR-10 (90.63%), with generalization gaps of 0.48% and 7.14%, respectively.
Our work bridges theoretical insights and practical advancements, offering a
robust framework for enhancing DNN generalization suitable for high-stakes
applications.

Abstract: Efficient sampling from high-dimensional and multimodal unnormalized
probability distributions is a central challenge in many areas of science and
machine learning. We focus on Boltzmann generators (BGs) that aim to sample the
Boltzmann distribution of physical systems, such as molecules, at a given
temperature. Classical variational approaches that minimize the reverse
Kullback-Leibler divergence are prone to mode collapse, while annealing-based
methods, commonly using geometric schedules, can suffer from mass teleportation
and rely heavily on schedule tuning. We introduce Constrained Mass Transport
(CMT), a variational framework that generates intermediate distributions under
constraints on both the KL divergence and the entropy decay between successive
steps. These constraints enhance distributional overlap, mitigate mass
teleportation, and counteract premature convergence. Across standard BG
benchmarks and the here introduced ELIL tetrapeptide, the largest system
studied to date without access to samples from molecular dynamics, CMT
consistently surpasses state-of-the-art variational methods, achieving more
than 2.5x higher effective sample size while avoiding mode collapse.

Abstract: Heterogeneous temporal graphs (HTGs) are ubiquitous data structures in the
real world. Recently, to enhance representation learning on HTGs, numerous
attention-based neural networks have been proposed. Despite these successes,
existing methods rely on a decoupled temporal and spatial learning paradigm,
which weakens interactions of spatio-temporal information and leads to a high
model complexity. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel learning paradigm for
HTGs called Simple and Efficient Heterogeneous Temporal Graph N}eural Network
(SE-HTGNN). Specifically, we innovatively integrate temporal modeling into
spatial learning via a novel dynamic attention mechanism, which retains
attention information from historical graph snapshots to guide subsequent
attention computation, thereby improving the overall discriminative
representations learning of HTGs. Additionally, to comprehensively and
adaptively understand HTGs, we leverage large language models to prompt
SE-HTGNN, enabling the model to capture the implicit properties of node types
as prior knowledge. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SE-HTGNN achieves up
to 10x speed-up over the state-of-the-art and latest baseline while maintaining
the best forecasting accuracy.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are powerful tools for learning from
graph-structured data but often produce biased predictions with respect to
sensitive attributes. Fairness-aware GNNs have been actively studied for
mitigating biased predictions. However, no prior studies have evaluated
fairness-aware GNNs on knowledge graphs, which are one of the most important
graphs in many applications, such as recommender systems. Therefore, we
introduce a benchmarking study on knowledge graphs. We generate new graphs from
three knowledge graphs, YAGO, DBpedia, and Wikidata, that are significantly
larger than the existing graph datasets used in fairness studies. We benchmark
inprocessing and preprocessing methods in different GNN backbones and early
stopping conditions. We find several key insights: (i) knowledge graphs show
different trends from existing datasets; clearer trade-offs between prediction
accuracy and fairness metrics than other graphs in fairness-aware GNNs, (ii)
the performance is largely affected by not only fairness-aware GNN methods but
also GNN backbones and early stopping conditions, and (iii) preprocessing
methods often improve fairness metrics, while inprocessing methods improve
prediction accuracy.

Abstract: Ensuring the safe exploration of reinforcement learning (RL) agents is
critical for deployment in real-world systems. Yet existing approaches struggle
to strike the right balance: methods that tightly enforce safety often cripple
task performance, while those that prioritize reward leave safety constraints
frequently violated, producing diffuse cost landscapes that flatten gradients
and stall policy improvement. We introduce the Uncertain Safety Critic (USC), a
novel approach that integrates uncertainty-aware modulation and refinement into
critic training. By concentrating conservatism in uncertain and costly regions
while preserving sharp gradients in safe areas, USC enables policies to achieve
effective reward-safety trade-offs. Extensive experiments show that USC reduces
safety violations by approximately 40% while maintaining competitive or higher
rewards, and reduces the error between predicted and true cost gradients by
approximately 83%, breaking the prevailing trade-off between safety and
performance and paving the way for scalable safe RL.

finite-sample safety guarantees into semantic segmentation, yielding calibrated
hazard maps with rigorous bounds for missed detections. These maps induce
risk-aware cost fields for downstream RL planning. Across two satellite-derived
benchmarks, COPPOL increases hazard coverage (up to 6x) compared to comparative
baselines, achieving near-complete detection of unsafe regions while reducing
hazardous violations during navigation (up to approx 50%). More importantly,
our approach remains robust to distributional shift, preserving both safety and

Abstract: The ROC curve is widely used to assess binary classification performance. Yet
for some applications such as alert systems for hospitalized patient
monitoring, conventional ROC analysis cannot capture crucial factors that
impact deployment, such as enforcing a minimum precision constraint to avoid
false alarm fatigue or imposing an upper bound on the number of predicted
positives to represent the capacity of hospital staff. The usual area under the
curve metric also does not reflect asymmetric costs for false positives and
false negatives. In this paper we address all three of these issues. First, we
show how the subset of classifiers that meet given precision and capacity
constraints can be represented as a feasible region in ROC space. We establish
the geometry of this feasible region. We then define the partial area of lesser
classifiers, a performance metric that is monotonic with cost and only accounts
for the feasible portion of ROC space. Averaging this area over a desired range
of cost parameters results in the partial volume over the ROC surface, or
partial VOROS. In experiments predicting mortality risk using vital sign
history on the MIMIC-IV dataset, we show this cost-aware metric is better than
alternatives for ranking classifiers in hospital alert applications.

Abstract: LLMs are often used by downstream users as teacher models for knowledge
distillation, compressing their capabilities into memory-efficient models.
However, as these teacher models may stem from untrusted parties, distillation
can raise unexpected security risks. In this paper, we investigate the security
implications of knowledge distillation from backdoored teacher models. First,
we show that prior backdoors mostly do not transfer onto student models. Our
key insight is that this is because existing LLM backdooring methods choose
trigger tokens that rarely occur in usual contexts. We argue that this
underestimates the security risks of knowledge distillation and introduce a new
backdooring technique, T-MTB, that enables the construction and study of
transferable backdoors. T-MTB carefully constructs a composite backdoor
trigger, made up of several specific tokens that often occur individually in
anticipated distillation datasets. As such, the poisoned teacher remains
stealthy, while during distillation the individual presence of these tokens
provides enough signal for the backdoor to transfer onto the student. Using
T-MTB, we demonstrate and extensively study the security risks of transferable
backdoors across two attack scenarios, jailbreaking and content modulation, and
across four model families of LLMs.

Abstract: As AI systems enter high-stakes domains, evaluation must extend beyond
predictive accuracy to include explainability, fairness, robustness, and
sustainability. We introduce RAISE (Responsible AI Scoring and Evaluation), a
unified framework that quantifies model performance across these four
dimensions and aggregates them into a single, holistic Responsibility Score. We
evaluated three deep learning models: a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), a Tabular
ResNet, and a Feature Tokenizer Transformer, on structured datasets from
finance, healthcare, and socioeconomics. Our findings reveal critical
trade-offs: the MLP demonstrated strong sustainability and robustness, the
Transformer excelled in explainability and fairness at a very high
environmental cost, and the Tabular ResNet offered a balanced profile. These
results underscore that no single model dominates across all responsibility
criteria, highlighting the necessity of multi-dimensional evaluation for
responsible model selection. Our implementation is available at:

Abstract: Feature selection is a combinatorial optimization problem that is NP-hard.
Conventional approaches often employ heuristic or greedy strategies, which are
prone to premature convergence and may fail to capture subtle yet informative
features. This limitation becomes especially critical in high-dimensional
datasets, where complex and interdependent feature relationships prevail. We
introduce the HeFS (Helper-Enhanced Feature Selection) framework to refine
feature subsets produced by existing algorithms. HeFS systematically searches
the residual feature space to identify a Helper Set - features that complement
the original subset and improve classification performance. The approach
employs a biased initialization scheme and a ratio-guided mutation mechanism
within a genetic algorithm, coupled with Pareto-based multi-objective
optimization to jointly maximize predictive accuracy and feature
complementarity. Experiments on 18 benchmark datasets demonstrate that HeFS
consistently identifies overlooked yet informative features and achieves
superior performance over state-of-the-art methods, including in challenging
domains such as gastric cancer classification, drug toxicity prediction, and
computer science applications. The code and datasets are available at

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are the predominant architecture for learning
over graphs. As with any machine learning model, and important issue is the
detection of adversarial attacks, where an adversary can change the output with
a small perturbation of the input. Techniques for solving the adversarial
robustness problem - determining whether such an attack exists - were
originally developed for image classification, but there are variants for many
other machine learning architectures. In the case of graph learning, the attack
model usually considers changes to the graph structure in addition to or
instead of the numerical features of the input, and the state of the art
techniques in the area proceed via reduction to constraint solving, working on
top of powerful solvers, e.g. for mixed integer programming. We show that it is
possible to improve on the state of the art in structural robustness by
replacing the use of powerful solvers by calls to efficient partial solvers,
which run in polynomial time but may be incomplete. We evaluate our tool
RobLight on a diverse set of GNN variants and datasets.

Abstract: Identifying from observation data the governing differential equations of a
physical dynamics is a key challenge in machine learning. Although approaches
based on SINDy have shown great promise in this area, they still fail to
address a whole class of real world problems where the data is sparsely sampled
in time. In this article, we introduce Unrolled-SINDy, a simple methodology
that leverages an unrolling scheme to improve the stability of explicit methods
for PDE discovery. By decorrelating the numerical time step size from the
sampling rate of the available data, our approach enables the recovery of
equation parameters that would not be the minimizers of the original SINDy
optimization problem due to large local truncation errors. Our method can be
exploited either through an iterative closed-form approach or by a gradient
descent scheme. Experiments show the versatility of our method. On both
traditional SINDy and state-of-the-art noise-robust iNeuralSINDy, with
different numerical schemes (Euler, RK4), our proposed unrolling scheme allows
to tackle problems not accessible to non-unrolled methods.

Abstract: We study the learnability of languages in the Next Symbol Prediction (NSP)
setting, where a learner receives only positive examples from a language
together with, for every prefix, (i) whether the prefix itself is in the
language and (ii) which next symbols can lead to an accepting string. This
setting has been used in prior works to empirically analyze neural sequence
models, and additionally, we observe that efficient algorithms for the NSP
setting can be used to learn the (truncated) support of language models. We
formalize the setting so as to make it amenable to PAC-learning analysis. While
the setting provides a much richer set of labels than the conventional
classification setting, we show that learning concept classes such as DFAs and
Boolean formulas remains computationally hard. The proof is via a construction
that makes almost all additional labels uninformative, yielding a reduction
from the conventional learning problem to learning with NSP labels. Under
cryptographic assumptions, the reduction implies that the problem of learning
DFAs is computationally hard in the NSP setting.

Abstract: Transformer architectures can solve unseen tasks based on input-output pairs
in a given prompt due to in-context learning (ICL). Existing theoretical
studies on ICL have mainly focused on linear regression tasks, often with
i.i.d. inputs. To understand how transformers express ICL when modeling
dynamics-driven functions, we investigate Markovian function learning through a
structured ICL setup, where we characterize the loss landscape to reveal
underlying optimization behaviors. Specifically, we (1) provide the closed-form
expression of the global minimizer (in an enlarged parameter space) for a
single-layer linear self-attention (LSA) model; (2) prove that recovering
transformer parameters that realize the optimal solution is NP-hard in general,
revealing a fundamental limitation of one-layer LSA in representing structured
dynamical functions; and (3) supply a novel interpretation of a multilayer LSA
as performing preconditioned gradient descent to optimize multiple objectives
beyond the square loss. These theoretical results are numerically validated
using simplified transformers.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Water is essential for agricultural productivity. Assessing water shortages
and reduced yield potential is a critical factor in decision-making for
ensuring agricultural productivity and food security. Crop simulation models,
which align with physical processes, offer intrinsic explainability but often
perform poorly. Conversely, machine learning models for crop yield modeling are
powerful and scalable, yet they commonly operate as black boxes and lack
adherence to the physical principles of crop growth. This study bridges this
gap by coupling the advantages of both worlds. We postulate that the crop yield
is inherently defined by the water availability. Therefore, we formulate crop
yield as a function of temporal water scarcity and predict both the crop
drought stress and the sensitivity to water scarcity at fine-scale resolution.
Sequentially modeling the crop yield response to water enables accurate yield
prediction. To enforce physical consistency, a novel physics-informed loss
function is proposed. We leverage multispectral satellite imagery,
meteorological data, and fine-scale yield data. Further, to account for the
uncertainty within the model, we build upon a deep ensemble approach. Our
method surpasses state-of-the-art models like LSTM and Transformers in crop
yield prediction with a coefficient of determination ($R^2$-score) of up to
0.82 while offering high explainability. This method offers decision support
for industry, policymakers, and farmers in building a more resilient
agriculture in times of changing climate conditions.

Abstract: We propose a flexible probabilistic model for predicting turn-taking patterns
in group conversations based solely on individual characteristics and past
speaking behavior. Many models of conversation dynamics cannot yield insights
that generalize beyond a single group. Moreover, past works often aim to
characterize speaking behavior through a universal formulation that may not be
suitable for all groups. We thus develop a generalization of prior conversation
models that predicts speaking turns among individuals in any group based on
their individual characteristics, that is, personality traits, and prior
speaking behavior. Importantly, our approach provides the novel ability to
learn how speaking inclination varies based on when individuals last spoke. We
apply our model to synthetic and real-world conversation data to verify the
proposed approach and characterize real group interactions. Our results
demonstrate that previous behavioral models may not always be realistic,
motivating our data-driven yet theoretically grounded approach.

Abstract: The vast majority of cardiovascular diseases may be preventable if early
signs and risk factors are detected. Cardiovascular monitoring with body-worn
sensor devices like sensor patches allows for the detection of such signs while
preserving the freedom and comfort of patients. However, the analysis of the
sensor data must be robust, reliable, efficient, and highly accurate. Deep
learning methods can automate data interpretation, reducing the workload of
clinicians. In this work, we analyze the feasibility of applying deep learning
models to the classification of synchronized electrocardiogram (ECG) and
phonocardiogram (PCG) recordings on resource-constrained medical edge devices.
We propose a convolutional neural network with early fusion of data to solve a
binary classification problem. We train and validate our model on the
synchronized ECG and PCG recordings from the Physionet Challenge 2016 dataset.
Our approach reduces memory footprint and compute cost by three orders of
magnitude compared to the state-of-the-art while maintaining competitive
accuracy. We demonstrate the applicability of our proposed model on medical
edge devices by analyzing energy consumption on a microcontroller and an
experimental sensor device setup, confirming that on-device inference can be
more energy-efficient than continuous data streaming.

Abstract: The reasoning large language model (RLLM) has been proven competitive in
solving complex reasoning tasks such as mathematics, coding, compared to
general LLM. However, the serving performance and behavior of RLLM remains
unexplored, which may undermine the deployment and utilization of RLLM in
real-world scenario. To close this gap, in this paper, we conduct a
comprehensive study of RLLM service. We first perform a pilot study on
comparing the serving performance between RLLM and traditional LLM and reveal
that there are several distinct differences regarding serving behavior: (1)
significant memory usage and fluctuations; (2) straggler requests; (3) adaptive
running time; (4) domain preference. Then we further investigate whether
existing inference optimization techniques are valid for RLLM. Our main
takeaways are that model quantization methods and speculative decoding can
improve service system efficiency with small compromise to RLLM accuracy, while
prefix caching, KV cache quantization may even degrade accuracy or serving
performance for small RLLM. Lastly, we conduct evaluation under real world
workload modeled by Gamma distribution to verify our findings. Empirical
results of real world workload evaluation across different dataset are aligned
with our main findings regarding RLLM serving. We hope our work can provide the
research community and industry with insights to advance RLLM inference
serving.

Abstract: Casting complex inputs into tractable representations is a critical step
across various fields. Diverse embedding models emerge from differences in
architectures, loss functions, input modalities and datasets, each capturing
unique aspects of the input. Multi-teacher distillation leverages this
diversity to enrich representations but often remains tailored to specific
tasks. In this paper, we introduce a task-agnostic framework based on a
``majority vote" objective function. We demonstrate that this function is
bounded by the mutual information between student and teachers' embeddings,
leading to a task-agnostic distillation loss that eliminates dependence on
task-specific labels or prior knowledge. Our evaluations across text, vision
models, and molecular modeling show that our method effectively leverages
teacher diversity, resulting in representations enabling better performance for
a wide range of downstream tasks such as classification, clustering, or
regression. Additionally, we train and release state-of-the-art embedding
models, enhancing downstream performance in various modalities.

Abstract: Traditional reinforcement learning (RL) assumes the agents make decisions
based on Markov decision processes (MDPs) with one-step transition models. In
many real-world applications, such as energy management and stock investment,
agents can access multi-step predictions of future states, which provide
additional advantages for decision making. However, multi-step predictions are
inherently high-dimensional: naively embedding these predictions into an MDP
leads to an exponential blow-up in state space and the curse of dimensionality.
Moreover, existing RL theory provides few tools to analyze prediction-augmented
MDPs, as it typically works on one-step transition kernels and cannot
accommodate multi-step predictions with errors or partial action-coverage. We
address these challenges with three key innovations: First, we propose the
\emph{Bayesian value function} to characterize the optimal prediction-aware
policy tractably. Second, we develop a novel \emph{Bellman-Jensen Gap} analysis
on the Bayesian value function, which enables characterizing the value of
imperfect predictions. Third, we introduce BOLA (Bayesian Offline Learning with
Online Adaptation), a two-stage model-based RL algorithm that separates offline
Bayesian value learning from lightweight online adaptation to real-time
predictions. We prove that BOLA remains sample-efficient even under imperfect
predictions. We validate our theory and algorithm on synthetic MDPs and a
real-world wind energy storage control problem.

Abstract: Accurate weather forecasting across time scales is critical for anticipating
and mitigating the impacts of climate change. Recent data-driven methods based
on deep learning have achieved significant success in the medium range, but
struggle at longer subseasonal-to-seasonal (S2S) horizons due to error
accumulation in their autoregressive approach. In this work, we propose
OmniCast, a scalable and skillful probabilistic model that unifies weather
forecasting across timescales. OmniCast consists of two components: a VAE model
that encodes raw weather data into a continuous, lower-dimensional latent
space, and a diffusion-based transformer model that generates a sequence of
future latent tokens given the initial conditioning tokens. During training, we
mask random future tokens and train the transformer to estimate their
distribution given conditioning and visible tokens using a per-token diffusion
head. During inference, the transformer generates the full sequence of future
tokens by iteratively unmasking random subsets of tokens. This joint sampling
across space and time mitigates compounding errors from autoregressive
approaches. The low-dimensional latent space enables modeling long sequences of
future latent states, allowing the transformer to learn weather dynamics beyond
initial conditions. OmniCast performs competitively with leading probabilistic
methods at the medium-range timescale while being 10x to 20x faster, and
achieves state-of-the-art performance at the subseasonal-to-seasonal scale
across accuracy, physics-based, and probabilistic metrics. Furthermore, we
demonstrate that OmniCast can generate stable rollouts up to 100 years ahead.

Abstract: We study online preference-based reinforcement learning (PbRL) with the goal
of improving sample efficiency. While a growing body of theoretical work has
emerged-motivated by PbRL's recent empirical success, particularly in aligning
large language models (LLMs)-most existing studies focus only on pairwise
comparisons. A few recent works (Zhu et al., 2023, Mukherjee et al., 2024,
Thekumparampil et al., 2024) have explored using multiple comparisons and
ranking feedback, but their performance guarantees fail to improve-and can even
deteriorate-as the feedback length increases, despite the richer information
available. To address this gap, we adopt the Plackett-Luce (PL) model for
ranking feedback over action subsets and propose M-AUPO, an algorithm that
selects multiple actions by maximizing the average uncertainty within the
offered subset. We prove that M-AUPO achieves a suboptimality gap of
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\left( \frac{d}{T} \sqrt{ \sum_{t=1}^T \frac{1}{|S_t|}}
\right)$, where $T$ is the total number of rounds, $d$ is the feature
dimension, and $|S_t|$ is the size of the subset at round $t$. This result
shows that larger subsets directly lead to improved performance and, notably,
the bound avoids the exponential dependence on the unknown parameter's norm,
which was a fundamental limitation in most previous works. Moreover, we
establish a near-matching lower bound of $\Omega \left( \frac{d}{K \sqrt{T}}
\right)$, where $K$ is the maximum subset size. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first theoretical result in PbRL with ranking feedback that
explicitly shows improved sample efficiency as a function of the subset size.

Abstract: Causal inference is essential for developing and evaluating medical
interventions, yet real-world medical datasets are often difficult to access
due to regulatory barriers. This makes synthetic data a potentially valuable
asset that enables these medical analyses, along with the development of new
inference methods themselves. Generative models can produce synthetic data that
closely approximate real data distributions, yet existing methods do not
consider the unique challenges that downstream causal inference tasks, and
specifically those focused on treatments, pose. We establish a set of
desiderata that synthetic data containing treatments should satisfy to maximise
downstream utility: preservation of (i) the covariate distribution, (ii) the
treatment assignment mechanism, and (iii) the outcome generation mechanism.
Based on these desiderata, we propose a set of evaluation metrics to assess
such synthetic data. Finally, we present STEAM: a novel method for generating
Synthetic data for Treatment Effect Analysis in Medicine that mimics the
data-generating process of data containing treatments and optimises for our
desiderata. We empirically demonstrate that STEAM achieves state-of-the-art
performance across our metrics as compared to existing generative models,
particularly as the complexity of the true data-generating process increases.

Abstract: Fractional Gradient Descent (FGD) offers a novel and promising way to
accelerate optimization by incorporating fractional calculus into machine
learning. Although FGD has shown encouraging initial results across various
optimization tasks, it faces significant challenges with convergence behavior
and hyperparameter selection. Moreover, the impact of its hyperparameters is
not fully understood, and scheduling them is particularly difficult in
non-convex settings such as neural network training. To address these issues,
we propose a novel approach called Learning to Optimize Caputo Fractional
Gradient Descent (L2O-CFGD), which meta-learns how to dynamically tune the
hyperparameters of Caputo FGD (CFGD). Our method's meta-learned schedule
outperforms CFGD with static hyperparameters found through an extensive search
and, in some tasks, achieves performance comparable to a fully black-box
meta-learned optimizer. L2O-CFGD can thus serve as a powerful tool for
researchers to identify high-performing hyperparameters and gain insights on
how to leverage the history-dependence of the fractional differential in
optimization.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Despite significant work on low-bit quantization-aware training (QAT), there
is still a large accuracy gap between such techniques and native training. To
address this, we introduce CAGE (Curvature-Aware Gradient Estimation), a new
QAT method that augments the straight-through estimator (STE) gradient with a
curvature-aware correction designed to counteract the loss increase induced by
quantization. CAGE is derived from a multi-objective view of QAT that balances
loss minimization with adherence to quantization constraints, yielding a
principled correction term that depends on local curvature information. On the
theoretical side, we introduce the notion of Pareto-optimal solutions for
quantized optimization, and establish that CAGE yields strong convergence
guarantees in the smooth non-convex setting. In terms of implementation, our
approach is optimizer-agnostic, but we provide a highly-efficient
implementation that leverages Adam statistics. When pre-training Llama-style
models of up to 800M-parameters, CAGE recovers over 10% of the
quantization-induced loss increase in the W4A4 regime over outlier-mitigation
methods. These results indicate that curvature-aware gradient corrections can
bridge the remaining performance gap beyond current outlier-handling methods.

Abstract: Online topic models are unsupervised algorithms to identify latent topics in
data streams that continuously evolve over time. Although these methods
naturally align with real-world scenarios, they have received considerably less
attention from the community compared to their offline counterparts, due to
specific additional challenges. To tackle these issues, we present SB-SETM, an
innovative model extending the Embedded Topic Model (ETM) to process data
streams by merging models formed on successive partial document batches. To
this end, SB-SETM (i) leverages a truncated stick-breaking construction for the
topic-per-document distribution, enabling the model to automatically infer from
the data the appropriate number of active topics at each timestep; and (ii)
introduces a merging strategy for topic embeddings based on a continuous
formulation of optimal transport adapted to the high dimensionality of the
latent topic space. Numerical experiments show SB-SETM outperforming baselines
on simulated scenarios. We extensively test it on a real-world corpus of news
articles covering the Russian-Ukrainian war throughout 2022-2023.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Biological learning unfolds continuously in time, yet most algorithmic models
rely on discrete updates and separate inference and learning phases. We study a
continuous-time neural model that unifies several biologically plausible
learning algorithms and removes the need for phase separation. Rules including
stochastic gradient descent (SGD), feedback alignment (FA), direct feedback
alignment (DFA), and Kolen-Pollack (KP) emerge naturally as limiting cases of
the dynamics. Simulations show that these continuous-time networks stably learn
at biological timescales, even under temporal mismatches and integration noise.
Through analysis and simulation, we show that learning depends on temporal
overlap: a synapse updates correctly only when its input and the corresponding
error signal coincide in time. When inputs are held constant, learning strength
declines linearly as the delay between input and error approaches the stimulus
duration, explaining observed robustness and failure across network depths.
Critically, robust learning requires the synaptic plasticity timescale to
exceed the stimulus duration by one to two orders of magnitude. For typical
cortical stimuli (tens of milliseconds), this places the functional plasticity
window in the few-second range, a testable prediction that identifies
seconds-scale eligibility traces as necessary for error-driven learning in
biological circuits.

Abstract: Leave-One-Out (LOO) provides an intuitive measure of feature importance but
is computationally prohibitive. While Layer-Wise Relevance Propagation (LRP)
offers a potentially efficient alternative, its axiomatic soundness in modern
Transformers remains largely under-examined. In this work, we first show that
the bilinear propagation rules used in recent advances of AttnLRP violate the
implementation invariance axiom. We prove this analytically and confirm it
empirically in linear attention layers. Second, we also revisit CP-LRP as a
diagnostic baseline and find that bypassing relevance propagation through the
softmax layer -- backpropagating relevance only through the value matrices --
significantly improves alignment with LOO, particularly in middle-to-late
Transformer layers. Overall, our results suggest that (i) bilinear
factorization sensitivity and (ii) softmax propagation error potentially
jointly undermine LRP's ability to approximate LOO in Transformers.

Abstract: Iterative optimization is central to modern artificial intelligence (AI) and
provides a crucial framework for understanding adaptive systems. This review
provides a unified perspective on this subject, bridging classic theory with
neural network training and biological learning. Although gradient-based
methods, powered by the efficient but biologically implausible backpropagation
(BP), dominate machine learning, their computational demands can hinder
scalability in high-dimensional settings. In contrast, derivative-free or
zeroth-order (ZO) optimization feature computationally lighter approaches that
rely only on function evaluations and randomness. While generally less sample
efficient, recent breakthroughs demonstrate that modern ZO methods can
effectively approximate gradients and achieve performance competitive with BP
in neural network models. This ZO paradigm is also particularly relevant for
biology. Its core principles of random exploration (probing) and
feedback-guided adaptation (reinforcing) parallel key mechanisms of biological
learning, offering a mathematically principled perspective on how the brain
learns. In this review, we begin by categorizing optimization approaches based
on the order of derivative information they utilize, ranging from first-,
second-, and higher-order gradient-based to ZO methods. We then explore how
these methods are adapted to the unique challenges of neural network training
and the resulting learning dynamics. Finally, we build upon these insights to
view biological learning through an optimization lens, arguing that a ZO
paradigm leverages the brain's intrinsic noise as a computational resource.
This framework not only illuminates our understanding of natural intelligence
but also holds vast implications for neuromorphic hardware, helping us design
fast and energy-efficient AI systems that exploit intrinsic hardware noise.

Abstract: We present a simple, self-help online supervised finetuning (OSFT) paradigm
for LLM reasoning. In this paradigm, the model generates its own responses and
is immediately finetuned on this self-generated data. OSFT is a highly
efficient training strategy for LLM reasoning, as it is reward-free and uses
just one rollout by default. Experiment results show that OSFT achieves
downstream performance on challenging mathematical reasoning tasks comparable
to strong reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) methods such as
GRPO. Our ablation study further demonstrates the efficiency and robustness of
OSFT. The major mechanism of OSFT lies in facilitating the model's own existing
preference (latent knowledge) learned from pretraining, which leads to
reasoning ability improvement. We believe that OSFT offers an efficient and
promising alternative to more complex, reward-based training paradigms. Our
code is available at https://github.com/ElementQi/OnlineSFT.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has become the
mainstream technique for training LLM agents. However, RLVR highly depends on
well-crafted task queries and corresponding ground-truth answers to provide
accurate rewards, which requires massive human efforts and hinders the RL
scaling processes, especially under agentic scenarios. Although a few recent
works explore task synthesis methods, the difficulty of generated agentic tasks
can hardly be controlled to provide effective RL training advantages. To
achieve agentic RLVR with higher scalability, we explore self-play training for
deep search agents, in which the learning LLM utilizes multi-turn search engine
calling and acts simultaneously as both a task proposer and a problem solver.
The task proposer aims to generate deep search queries with well-defined
ground-truth answers and increasing task difficulty. The problem solver tries
to handle the generated search queries and output the correct answer
predictions. To ensure that each generated search query has accurate ground
truth, we collect all the searching results from the proposer's trajectory as
external knowledge, then conduct retrieval-augmentation generation (RAG) to
test whether the proposed query can be correctly answered with all necessary
search documents provided. In this search self-play (SSP) game, the proposer
and the solver co-evolve their agent capabilities through both competition and
cooperation. With substantial experimental results, we find that SSP can
significantly improve search agents' performance uniformly on various
benchmarks without any supervision under both from-scratch and continuous RL
training setups. The code is at https://github.com/Alibaba-Quark/SSP.

Abstract: We introduce \textbf{BO4Mob}, a new benchmark framework for high-dimensional
Bayesian Optimization (BO), driven by the challenge of origin-destination (OD)
travel demand estimation in large urban road networks. Estimating OD travel
demand from limited traffic sensor data is a difficult inverse optimization
problem, particularly in real-world, large-scale transportation networks. This
problem involves optimizing over high-dimensional continuous spaces where each
objective evaluation is computationally expensive, stochastic, and
non-differentiable. BO4Mob comprises five scenarios based on real-world San
Jose, CA road networks, with input dimensions scaling up to 10,100. These
scenarios utilize high-resolution, open-source traffic simulations that
incorporate realistic nonlinear and stochastic dynamics. We demonstrate the
benchmark's utility by evaluating five optimization methods: three
state-of-the-art BO algorithms and two non-BO baselines. This benchmark is
designed to support both the development of scalable optimization algorithms
and their application for the design of data-driven urban mobility models,
including high-resolution digital twins of metropolitan road networks. Code and
documentation are available at https://github.com/UMN-Choi-Lab/BO4Mob.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Value-based algorithms are a cornerstone of off-policy reinforcement learning
due to their simplicity and training stability. However, their use has
traditionally been restricted to discrete action spaces, as they rely on
estimating Q-values for individual state-action pairs. In continuous action
spaces, evaluating the Q-value over the entire action space becomes
computationally infeasible. To address this, actor-critic methods are typically
employed, where a critic is trained on off-policy data to estimate Q-values,
and an actor is trained to maximize the critic's output. Despite their
popularity, these methods often suffer from instability during training. In
this work, we propose a purely value-based framework for continuous control
that revisits structural maximization of Q-functions, introducing a set of key
architectural and algorithmic choices to enable efficient and stable learning.
We evaluate the proposed actor-free Q-learning approach on a range of standard
simulation tasks, demonstrating performance and sample efficiency on par with
state-of-the-art baselines, without the cost of learning a separate actor.
Particularly, in environments with constrained action spaces, where the value
functions are typically non-smooth, our method with structural maximization
outperforms traditional actor-critic methods with gradient-based maximization.

Abstract: Counterfactual inference provides a mathematical framework for reasoning
about hypothetical outcomes under alternative interventions, bridging causal
reasoning and predictive modeling. We present a counterfactual inference
framework for individualized risk estimation and intervention analysis,
illustrated through a clinical application to post-acute sequelae of COVID-19
(PASC) among patients with pre-existing heart failure (HF). Using longitudinal
diagnosis, laboratory, and medication data from a large health-system cohort,
we integrate regularized predictive modeling with counterfactual search to
identify actionable pathways to PASC-related HF hospital admissions. The
framework combines exact enumeration with optimization-based methods, including
the Nearest Instance Counterfactual Explanations (NICE) and Multi-Objective
Counterfactuals (MOC) algorithms, to efficiently explore high-dimensional
intervention spaces. Applied to more than 2700 individuals with confirmed
SARS-CoV-2 infection and prior HF, the model achieved strong discriminative
performance (AUROC: 0.88, 95% CI: 0.84-0.91) and generated interpretable,
patient-specific counterfactuals that quantify how modifying comorbidity
patterns or treatment factors could alter predicted outcomes. This work
demonstrates how counterfactual reasoning can be formalized as an optimization
problem over predictive functions, offering a rigorous, interpretable, and
computationally efficient approach to personalized inference in complex
biomedical systems.

Abstract: Adapting language models (LMs) to new tasks via post-training carries the
risk of degrading existing capabilities -- a phenomenon classically known as
catastrophic forgetting. In this paper, toward identifying guidelines for
mitigating this phenomenon, we systematically compare the forgetting patterns
of two widely adopted post-training methods: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and
reinforcement learning (RL). Our experiments reveal a consistent trend across
LM families (Llama, Qwen) and tasks (instruction following, general knowledge,
and arithmetic reasoning): RL leads to less forgetting than SFT while achieving
comparable or higher target task performance. To investigate the cause for this
difference, we consider a simplified setting in which the LM is modeled as a
mixture of two distributions, one corresponding to prior knowledge and the
other to the target task. We identify that the mode-seeking nature of RL, which
stems from its use of on-policy data, enables keeping prior knowledge intact
when learning the target task. We then verify this insight by demonstrating
that the use on-policy data underlies the robustness of RL to forgetting in
practical settings, as opposed to other algorithmic choices such as the KL
regularization or advantage estimation. Lastly, as a practical implication, our
results highlight the potential of mitigating forgetting using approximately
on-policy data, which can be substantially more efficient to obtain than fully
on-policy data.

Abstract: Simulating nuanced human social dynamics with Large Language Models (LLMs)
remains a significant challenge, particularly in achieving psychological depth
and consistent persona behavior crucial for high-fidelity training tools. This
paper introduces TACLA (Transactional Analysis Contextual LLM-based Agents), a
novel Multi-Agent architecture designed to overcome these limitations. TACLA
integrates core principles of Transactional Analysis (TA) by modeling agents as
an orchestrated system of distinct Parent, Adult, and Child ego states, each
with its own pattern memory. An Orchestrator Agent prioritizes ego state
activation based on contextual triggers and an agent's life script, ensuring
psychologically authentic responses. Validated in an educational scenario,
TACLA demonstrates realistic ego state shifts in Student Agents, effectively
modeling conflict de-escalation and escalation based on different teacher
intervention strategies. Evaluation shows high conversational credibility and
confirms TACLA's capacity to create dynamic, psychologically-grounded social
simulations, advancing the development of effective AI tools for education and
beyond.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Inference-time computation is a critical yet challenging paradigm for
enhancing the reasoning performance of large language models (LLMs). While
existing strategies improve reasoning stability and consistency, they suffer
from notable limitations: self-correction often reinforces the model's initial
biases, and Multi-Agent Collaboration (MAC) often fails due to the lack of
efficient coordination mechanisms, leading to collective errors. Although
high-performing verifiers can detect reasoning errors, making them reliable
requires substantial training. To address these challenges, we introduce a
novel inference-time framework, Adaptive Coopetition (AdCo), in which LLM
agents utilize an adaptive, UCB-based "coopetition" mechanism. At each round,
agents leverage coarse verifier signals to determine whether to collaborate or
compete, and iteratively refine their reasoning based on peer feedback. Without
relying on high-performance verifiers, our adaptive strategy achieves
significant performance gains on mathematical reasoning benchmarks, yielding a
20% relative improvement over baselines on the more challenging dataset. Our
approach remains robust and consistent in terms of accuracy under different
sample sizes and configurations. This adaptive, signal-guided "coopetition"
framework enhances reasoning robustness by leveraging both model knowledge
diversity and reasoning trace measures, while also promoting uncertainty-driven
exploration, especially when participants have comparable capabilities. From
this perspective, our work offers a fresh lens on inference-time computation
and paves the way for more resilient multi-agent LLM systems. Our code is

Abstract: We explore how physical scale and population size shape the emergence of
complex behaviors in open-ended ecological environments. In our setting, agents
are unsupervised and have no explicit rewards or learning objectives but
instead evolve over time according to reproduction, mutation, and natural
selection. As they act, agents also shape their environment and the population
around them in an ongoing dynamic ecology. Our goal is not to optimize a single
high-performance policy, but instead to examine how behaviors emerge and evolve
across large populations due to natural competition and environmental
pressures. In an effort to discover how complex behaviors naturally emerge, we
conduct experiments in large-scale worlds that reach populations of more than
60,000 individual agents, each with their own evolved neural network policy. We
identify various emergent behaviors such as long-range resource extraction,
vision-based foraging, and predation that arise under competitive and survival
pressures. We examine how sensing modalities and environmental scale affect the
emergence of these behaviors, finding that some appear only in sufficiently
large environments and populations, with larger scales increasing behavioral
stability and consistency. While there is a rich history of research in
evolutionary settings, our scaling results provide promising new directions to
explore ecology as an instrument of machine learning in an era of abundant
computational resources. Experimental code is available at

Abstract: This search introduces the Multimodal Socialized Learning Framework (M-S2L),
designed to foster emergent social intelligence in AI agents by integrating
Multimodal Large Language Models (M-LLMs) with social learning mechanisms. The
framework equips agents with multimodal perception (vision and text) and
structured action capabilities, enabling physical manipulation and grounded
multimodal communication (e.g., text with visual pointers). M-S2L combines
direct reinforcement learning with two novel social learning pathways:
multimodal observational learning and communication-driven learning from
feedback, augmented by an episodic memory system for long-term social context.
  We evaluate M-S2L in a Collaborative Assembly Environment (CAE), where agent
teams must construct complex devices from ambiguous blueprints under
informational asymmetry. Across tasks of increasing complexity, M-S2L agents
consistently outperform Text-Only and No-Social-Learning baselines in Task
Completion Rate and Time to Completion, particularly in dynamic problem-solving
scenarios. Ablation studies confirm the necessity of both multimodality and
socialized learning. Our analysis reveals the emergence of efficient
communication protocols integrating visual pointers with concise text,
alongside rapid role specialization leading to stable labor division.
Qualitative case studies demonstrate agents' abilities for shared awareness,
dynamic re-planning, and adaptive problem-solving, suggesting a nascent form of
machine social cognition. These findings indicate that integrating multimodal
perception with explicit social learning is critical for developing human-like
collaborative intelligence in multi-agent systems.

Abstract: Recent surges in LLM-driven intelligent systems largely overlook decades of
foundational multi-agent systems (MAS) research, resulting in frameworks with
critical limitations such as centralization and inadequate trust and
communication protocols. This paper introduces the Fetch.ai architecture, an
industrial-strength platform designed to bridge this gap by facilitating the
integration of classical MAS principles with modern AI capabilities. We present
a novel, multi-layered solution built on a decentralized foundation of on-chain
blockchain services for verifiable identity, discovery, and transactions. This
is complemented by a comprehensive development framework for creating secure,
interoperable agents, a cloud-based platform for deployment, and an intelligent
orchestration layer where an agent-native LLM translates high-level human goals
into complex, multi-agent workflows. We demonstrate the deployed nature of this
system through a decentralized logistics use case where autonomous agents
dynamically discover, negotiate, and transact with one another securely.
Ultimately, the Fetch.ai stack provides a principled architecture for moving
beyond current agent implementations towards open, collaborative, and
economically sustainable multi-agent ecosystems.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Modern socio-technical systems are characterized by strategic coopetition
where actors simultaneously cooperate to create value and compete to capture
it. While conceptual modeling languages like i* provide rich qualitative
representations of strategic dependencies, they lack mechanisms for
quantitative analysis of dynamic trade-offs. Conversely, classical game theory
offers mathematical rigor but strips away contextual richness. This technical
report bridges this gap by developing computational foundations that formalize
two critical dimensions of coopetition: interdependence and complementarity. We
ground interdependence in i* structural dependency analysis, translating
depender-dependee-dependum relationships into quantitative interdependence
coefficients through a structured translation framework. We formalize
complementarity following Brandenburger and Nalebuff's Added Value concept,
modeling synergistic value creation with validated parameterization. We
integrate structural dependencies with bargaining power in value appropriation
and introduce a game-theoretic formulation where Nash Equilibrium incorporates
structural interdependence. Validation combines comprehensive experimental
testing across power and logarithmic value function specifications,
demonstrating functional form robustness, with empirical application to the
Samsung-Sony S-LCD joint venture (2004-2011), where logarithmic specifications
achieve superior empirical fit (validation score 45/60) while power functions
provide theoretical tractability. This technical report serves as the
foundational reference for a coordinated research program examining strategic
coopetition in requirements engineering and multi-agent systems, with companion
work addressing trust dynamics, team production, and reciprocity mechanisms.
