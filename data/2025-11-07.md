Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have significantly
accelerated progress in code translation, enabling more accurate and efficient
transformation across programming languages. While originally developed for
natural language processing, LLMs have shown strong capabilities in modeling
programming language syntax and semantics, outperforming traditional rule-based
systems in both accuracy and flexibility. These models have streamlined
cross-language conversion, reduced development overhead, and accelerated legacy
code migration. In this paper, we introduce OMPILOT, a novel domain-specific
encoder-decoder transformer tailored for translating C++ code into OpenMP,
enabling effective shared-memory parallelization. OMPILOT leverages custom
pre-training objectives that incorporate the semantics of parallel constructs
and combines both unsupervised and supervised learning strategies to improve
code translation robustness. Unlike previous work that focused primarily on
loop-level transformations, OMPILOT operates at the function level to capture a
wider semantic context. To evaluate our approach, we propose OMPBLEU, a novel
composite metric specifically crafted to assess the correctness and quality of
OpenMP parallel constructs, addressing limitations in conventional translation
metrics.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Edge Computing enables low-latency processing for real-time applications but
introduces challenges in power management due to the distributed nature of edge
devices and their limited energy resources. This paper proposes a stochastic
modeling approach using Markov Chains to analyze power state transitions in
Edge Computing. By deriving steady-state probabilities and evaluating energy
consumption, we demonstrate the benefits of AI-driven predictive power scaling
over conventional reactive methods. Monte Carlo simulations validate the model,
showing strong alignment between theoretical and empirical results. Sensitivity
analysis highlights how varying transition probabilities affect power
efficiency, confirming that predictive scaling minimizes unnecessary
transitions and improves overall system responsiveness. Our findings suggest
that AI-based power management strategies significantly enhance energy
efficiency by anticipating workload demands and optimizing state transitions.
Experimental results indicate that AI-based power management optimizes workload
distribution across heterogeneous edge nodes, reducing energy consumption
disparities between devices, improving overall efficiency, and enhancing
adaptive power coordination in multi-node environments.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Dynamic resource management is an increasingly important capability of High
Performance Computing systems, as it enables jobs to adjust their resource
allocation at runtime. This capability has been shown to reduce workload
makespan, substantially decrease job waiting times and improve overall system
utilization. In this context, malleability refers to the ability of
applications to adapt to new resource allocations during execution. Although
beneficial, malleability incurs significant reconfiguration costs, making the
reduction of these costs an important research topic.
  Some existing methods for MPI applications respawn the entire application,
which is an expensive solution that avoids the reuse of original processes.
Other MPI methods reuse them, but fail to fully release unneeded processes when
shrinking, since some ranks within the same communicator remain active across
nodes, preventing the application from returning those nodes to the system.
This work overcomes both limitations by proposing a novel parallel spawning
strategy, in which all processes cooperate in spawning before redistribution,
thereby reducing execution time. Additionally, it removes shrinkage
limitations, allowing better adaptation of parallel systems to workload and
reducing their makespan. As a result, it preserves competitive expansion times
with at most a $1.25\times$ overhead, while enabling fast shrink operations
that reduce their cost by at least $20\times$. This strategy has been validated
on both homogeneous and heterogeneous systems and can also be applied in
shared-resource environments.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Deploying large language models (LLMs) on end-user devices is gaining
importance due to benefits in responsiveness, privacy, and operational cost.
Yet the limited memory and compute capability of mobile and desktop GPUs make
efficient execution difficult. Recent observations suggest that the internal
activations of LLMs are often dynamically sparse, meaning that for each input,
only part of the network contributes significantly to the output. Such sparsity
could reduce computation, but it interacts poorly with group-wise quantization,
which remains the dominant approach for fitting LLMs onto resource-constrained
hardware. To reconcile these two properties, this study proposes a set of
techniques that realize dynamic sparse inference under low-bit quantization.
The method features: (1) a zigzag-patterned quantization layout that organizes
weights in a way consistent with activation sparsity and improves GPU memory
locality; (2) a specialized GEMV kernel designed for this layout to fully
utilize parallel compute units; and (3) a compact runtime mechanism that
gathers sparse indices with minimal overhead. Across several model scales and
hardware configurations, the approach achieves up to 1.55x faster decoding
throughput while maintaining accuracy comparable to dense quantized inference,
showing that structured sparsity and quantization can effectively coexist on
commodity GPUs.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Modern distributed systems face growing security threats, as attackers
continuously enhance their skills and vulnerabilities span across the entire
system stack, from hardware to the application layer. In the system design
phase, fault tolerance techniques can be employed to safeguard systems. From a
theoretical perspective, an attacker attempting to compromise a system can be
abstracted by considering the presence of Byzantine processes in the system.
Although this approach enhances the resilience of the distributed system, it
introduces certain limitations regarding the accuracy of the model in
reflecting real-world scenarios. In this paper, we consider a self-protecting
distributed system based on the \emph{Monitoring-Analyse-Plan-Execute over a
shared Knowledge} (MAPE-K) architecture, and we propose a new probabilistic
Mobile Byzantine Failure (MBF) that can be plugged into the Analysis component.
Our new model captures the dynamics of evolving attacks and can be used to
drive the self-protection and reconfiguration strategy. We analyze
mathematically the time that it takes until the number of Byzantine nodes
crosses given thresholds, or for the system to self-recover back into a safe
state, depending on the rates of Byzantine infection spreading \emph{vs.} the
rate of self-recovery. We also provide simulation results that illustrate the
behavior of the system under such assumptions.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Synchronization is the major obstacle to scalability in distributed
computing. Concurrent operations on the shared data engage in synchronization
when they encounter a \emph{conflict}, i.e., their effects depend on the order
in which they are applied. Ideally, one would like to detect conflicts in a
\emph{dynamic} manner, i.e., adjusting to the current system state. Indeed, it
is very common that two concurrent operations conflict only in some rarely
occurring states. In this paper, we define the notion of \emph{dynamic
concurrency}: an operation employs strong synchronization primitives only if it
\emph{has} to arbitrate with concurrent operations, given the current system
state. We then present a dynamically concurrent universal construction.

Abstract: We study the fundamental problem of fairly allocating a multiset
$\mathcal{M}$ of $t$ types of indivisible items among $d$ groups of agents,
where all agents within a group have identical additive valuations. Gorantla et
al. [GMV23] showed that for every such instance, there exists a finite number
$\mu$ such that, if each item type appears at least $\mu$ times, an envy-free
allocation exists. Their proof is non-constructive and only provides explicit
upper bounds on $\mu$ for the cases of two groups ($d=2$) or two item types
($t=2$).
  In this work, we resolve one of the main open questions posed by Gorantla et
al. [GMV23] by deriving explicit upper bounds on $\mu$ that hold for arbitrary
numbers of groups and item types. We introduce a significantly simpler, yet
powerful technique that not only yields constructive guarantees for indivisible
goods but also extends naturally to chores and continuous domains, leading to
new results in related fair division settings such as cake cutting.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The complexity of computing equilibrium refinements has been at the forefront
of algorithmic game theory research, but it has remained open in the seminal
class of potential games; we close this fundamental gap in this paper.
  We first establish that computing a pure-strategy perfect equilibrium is
$\mathsf{PLS}$-complete under different game representations -- including
extensive-form games and general polytope games, thereby being polynomial-time
equivalent to pure Nash equilibria. For normal-form proper equilibria, our main
result is that a perturbed (proper) best response can be computed efficiently
in extensive-form games. As a byproduct, we establish
$\mathsf{FIXP}_a$-completeness of normal-form proper equilibria in
extensive-form games, resolving a long-standing open problem. In stark
contrast, we show that computing a normal-form proper equilibrium in polytope
potential games is both $\mathsf{NP}$-hard and $\mathsf{coNP}$-hard.
  We next turn to more structured classes of games, namely symmetric network
congestion and symmetric matroid congestion games. For both classes, we show
that a perfect pure-strategy equilibrium can be computed in polynomial time,
strengthening the existing results for pure Nash equilibria. On the other hand,
we establish that, for a certain class of potential games, there is an
exponential separation in the length of the best-response path between perfect
and Nash equilibria.
  Finally, for mixed strategies, we prove that computing a point geometrically
near a perfect equilibrium requires a doubly exponentially small perturbation
even in $3$-player potential games in normal form. On the flip side, in the
special case of polymatrix potential games, we show that equilibrium
refinements are amenable to perturbed gradient descent dynamics, thereby
belonging to the complexity class $\mathsf{CLS}$.

Abstract: We study a model of subscription-based platforms where users pay a fixed fee
for unlimited access to content, and creators receive a share of the revenue.
Existing approaches to detecting fraud predominantly rely on machine learning
methods, engaging in an ongoing arms race with bad actors. We explore revenue
division mechanisms that inherently disincentivize manipulation. We formalize
three types of manipulation-resistance axioms and examine which existing rules
satisfy these. We show that a mechanism widely used by streaming platforms, not
only fails to prevent fraud, but also makes detecting manipulation
computationally intractable. We also introduce a novel rule, ScaledUserProp,
that satisfies all three manipulation-resistance axioms. Finally, experiments
with both real-world and synthetic streaming data support ScaledUserProp as a
fairer alternative compared to existing rules.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The Fisher market equilibrium for private goods and the Lindahl equilibrium
for public goods are classic and fundamental solution concepts for market
equilibria. While Fisher market equilibria have been well-studied, the
theoretical foundations for Lindahl equilibria remain substantially
underdeveloped.
  In this work, we propose a unified duality framework for market equilibria.
We show that Lindahl equilibria of a public goods market correspond to Fisher
market equilibria in a dual Fisher market with dual utilities, and vice versa.
The dual utility is based on the indirect utility, and the correspondence
between the two equilibria works by exchanging the roles of allocations and
prices.
  Using the duality framework, we address the gaps concerning the computation
and dynamics for Lindahl equilibria and obtain new insights and developments
for Fisher market equilibria. First, we leverage this duality to analyze
welfare properties of Lindahl equilibria. For concave homogeneous utilities, we
prove that a Lindahl equilibrium maximizes Nash Social Welfare (NSW). For
concave non-homogeneous utilities, we show that a Lindahl equilibrium achieves
$(1/e)^{1/e}$ approximation to the optimal NSW, and the approximation ratio is
tight. Second, we apply the duality framework to market dynamics, including
proportional response dynamics (PRD) and t\^atonnement. We obtain new market
dynamics for the Lindahl equilibria from market dynamics in the dual Fisher
market. We also use duality to extend PRD to markets with total complements
utilities, the dual class of gross substitutes utilities. Finally, we apply the
duality framework to markets with chores. We propose a program for private
chores for general convex homogeneous disutilities that avoids the "poles"
issue, whose KKT points correspond to Fisher market equilibria. We also
initiate the study of the Lindahl equilibrium for public chores.

Abstract: In recent years, the research of multi-agent systems has taken a direction to
explore larger and more complex models to fulfill sophisticated tasks. We point
out two possible pitfalls that might be caused by increasing complexity;
susceptibilities to faults, and performance bottlenecks. To prevent the former
threat, we propose a transaction-based framework to design very complex
multi-agent systems (VCMAS). To address the second threat, we offer to
integrate transaction scheduling into the proposed framework. We implemented
both of these ideas to develop the OptiMA framework and show that it is able to
facilitate the execution of VCMAS with more than a hundred agents. We also
demonstrate the effect of transaction scheduling on such a system by showing
improvements up to more than 16\%. Furthermore, we also performed a theoretical
analysis on the transaction scheduling problem and provided practical tools
that can be used for future research on it.

Abstract: Optimizing large-language model (LLM) training on distributed domain-specific
accelerator systems presents significant challenges due to its complex
optimization space. Existing optimization methods, however, rely on
time-consuming manual tuning or resource-intensive black-box searches, which
struggle to keep pace with the rapidly evolving LLM domain, leading to slow
development and underutilized resources. To address this, we introduce ASAP, an
Agentic Solution to Auto-optimize Performance of Large-Scale LLM Training. It
is a multi-agent system, featuring Coordinator, Analyzer, and Proposal agents,
which integrates LLM reasoning with insights from performance profiling tools,
roofline analysis, and a knowledge base of best practices and successful past
optimizations from human experts. Our proposed design can automate the
diagnosis of performance bottlenecks and recommend optimized sharding
configurations with reasoning, thus effectively improving the efficiency of
distributed LLM training. Experiments have shown that the ASAP-generated
sharding configurations can contribute up to 28% training step time reduction
and 1.43 times throughput improvement. When combined with additional
optimization from human experts, throughput can be further increased to 2.58
times. The proposed ASAP promises to provide a scalable and explainable
methodology for AI-assisted performance engineering in large-scale LLM
training.

Abstract: Automatic question generation (AQG) for mathematics education remains an
elusive goal for Intelligent Tutoring Systems and educators. While pre-trained
transformer-based language models have significantly advanced natural language
generation, they often struggle to precisely control problem complexity and
cognitive demands. In this paper, we introduce a collaborative multi-agent
framework as a novel method of incorporating inference-time computation into
AQG. This approach leverages multiple agents that iteratively refine generated
question-answer pairs to better balance complexity and cognitive demand. We
evaluate the generated questions on five meta-evaluation criteria: relevance,
importance, clarity, difficulty matching, answerability, to assess the system's
ability to control the required complexity and quality of the questions.
Preliminary evaluations show that this collaborative multi-agent framework
elevates the quality of generated educational content by fostering a more
nuanced balance between cognitive challenge and clarity. These promising
outcomes suggest that integrating collaborative multi-agent workflows can yield
more controlled, pedagogically valuable content that can help advance automated
educational content generation and adaptive learning environments.

Abstract: Grasslands, constituting the world's second-largest terrestrial carbon sink,
play a crucial role in biodiversity and the regulation of the carbon cycle.
Currently, the Irish dairy sector, a significant economic contributor, grapples
with challenges related to profitability and sustainability. Presently, grass
growth forecasting relies on impractical mechanistic models. In response, we
propose deep learning models tailored for univariate datasets, presenting
cost-effective alternatives. Notably, a temporal convolutional network designed
for forecasting Perennial Ryegrass growth in Cork exhibits high performance,
leveraging historical grass height data with RMSE of 2.74 and MAE of 3.46.
Validation across a comprehensive dataset spanning 1,757 weeks over 34 years
provides insights into optimal model configurations. This study enhances our
understanding of model behavior, thereby improving reliability in grass growth
forecasting and contributing to the advancement of sustainable dairy farming
practices.

Abstract: This study presents a federated learning (FL) framework for
privacy-preserving electrocardiogram (ECG) classification in Internet of Things
(IoT) healthcare environments. By transforming 1D ECG signals into 2D Gramian
Angular Field (GAF) images, the proposed approach enables efficient feature
extraction through Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) while ensuring that
sensitive medical data remain local to each device. This work is among the
first to experimentally validate GAF-based federated ECG classification across
heterogeneous IoT devices, quantifying both performance and communication
efficiency. To evaluate feasibility in realistic IoT settings, we deployed the
framework across a server, a laptop, and a resource-constrained Raspberry Pi 4,
reflecting edge-cloud integration in IoT ecosystems. Experimental results
demonstrate that the FL-GAF model achieves a high classification accuracy of
95.18% in a multi-client setup, significantly outperforming a single-client
baseline in both accuracy and training time. Despite the added computational
complexity of GAF transformations, the framework maintains efficient resource
utilization and communication overhead. These findings highlight the potential
of lightweight, privacy-preserving AI for IoT-based healthcare monitoring,
supporting scalable and secure edge deployments in smart health systems.

Abstract: Short-video platforms have become a central medium in the modern Internet
landscape, where efficient information delivery and strong interactivity are
reshaping user engagement and cultural dissemination. Among the various forms
of user interaction, comments play a vital role in fostering community
participation and enabling content re-creation. However, generating comments
that are both compliant with platform guidelines and capable of exhibiting
stylistic diversity and contextual awareness remains a significant challenge.
We introduce LOLGORITHM, a modular multi-agent system (MAS) designed for
controllable short-video comment generation. The system integrates video
segmentation, contextual and affective analysis, and style-aware prompt
construction. It supports six distinct comment styles: puns (homophones),
rhyming, meme application, sarcasm (irony), plain humor, and content
extraction. Powered by a multimodal large language model (MLLM), LOLGORITHM
directly processes video inputs and achieves fine-grained style control through
explicit prompt markers and few-shot examples. To support development and
evaluation, we construct a bilingual dataset using official APIs from Douyin
(Chinese) and YouTube (English), covering five popular video genres: comedy
skits, daily life jokes, funny animal clips, humorous commentary, and talk
shows. Evaluation combines automated metrics originality, relevance, and style
conformity with a large-scale human preference study involving 40 videos and
105 participants. Results show that LOLGORITHM significantly outperforms
baseline models, achieving preference rates of over 90% on Douyin and 87.55% on
YouTube. This work presents a scalable and culturally adaptive framework for
stylized comment generation on short-video platforms, offering a promising path
to enhance user engagement and creative interaction.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) are central to applications such as swarm robotics
and traffic routing, where agents must coordinate in a decentralized manner to
achieve a common objective. Stochastic Shortest Path (SSP) problems provide a
natural framework for modeling decentralized control in such settings. While
the problem of learning in SSP has been extensively studied in single-agent
settings, the decentralized multi-agent variant remains largely unexplored. In
this work, we take a step towards addressing that gap. We study decentralized
multi-agent SSPs (Dec-MASSPs) under linear function approximation, where the
transition dynamics and costs are represented using linear models. Applying
novel symmetry-based arguments, we identify the structure of optimal policies.
Our main contribution is the first regret lower bound for this setting based on
the construction of hard-to-learn instances for any number of agents, $n$. Our
regret lower bound of $\Omega(\sqrt{K})$, over $K$ episodes, highlights the
inherent learning difficulty in Dec-MASSPs. These insights clarify the learning
complexity of decentralized control and can further guide the design of
efficient learning algorithms in multi-agent systems.

Abstract: Multimodal language models possess a remarkable ability to handle an
open-vocabulary's worth of objects. Yet the best models still suffer from
hallucinations when reasoning about scenes in the real world, revealing a gap
between their seemingly strong performance on existing perception benchmarks
that are saturating and their reasoning in the real world. To address this gap,
we build a novel benchmark of in-the-wild scenes that we call Common-O. With
more than 10.5k examples using exclusively new images not found in web training
data to avoid contamination, Common-O goes beyond just perception, inspired by
cognitive tests for humans, to probe reasoning across scenes by asking "what's
in common?". We evaluate leading multimodal language models, including models
specifically trained to perform chain-of-thought reasoning. We find that
perceiving objects in single images is tractable for most models, yet reasoning
across scenes is very challenging even for the best models, including reasoning
models. Despite saturating many leaderboards focusing on perception, the best
performing model only achieves 35% on Common-O -- and on Common-O Complex,
consisting of more complex scenes, the best model achieves only 1%. Curiously,
we find models are more prone to hallucinate when similar objects are present
in the scene, suggesting models may be relying on object co-occurrence seen
during training. Among the models we evaluated, we found scale can provide
modest improvements while models explicitly trained with multi-image inputs
show bigger improvements, suggesting scaled multi-image training may offer
promise. We make our benchmark publicly available to spur research into the
challenge of hallucination when reasoning across scenes.

Abstract: Recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved
state-of-the-art performance on numerous benchmark tasks. However, the use of
internet-scale, often proprietary, pretraining corpora raises a critical
concern for both practitioners and users: inflated performance due to test-set
leakage. While prior works have proposed mitigation strategies such as
decontamination of pretraining data and benchmark redesign for LLMs, the
complementary direction of developing detection methods for contaminated VLMs
remains underexplored. To address this gap, we deliberately contaminate
open-source VLMs on popular benchmarks and show that existing detection
approaches either fail outright or exhibit inconsistent behavior. We then
propose a novel simple yet effective detection method based on multi-modal
semantic perturbation, demonstrating that contaminated models fail to
generalize under controlled perturbations. Finally, we validate our approach
across multiple realistic contamination strategies, confirming its robustness
and effectiveness. The code and perturbed dataset will be released publicly.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Ensuring the privacy of sensitive training data is crucial in
privacy-preserving machine learning. However, in practical scenarios, privacy
protection may be required for only a subset of features. For instance, in ICU
data, demographic attributes like age and gender pose higher privacy risks due
to their re-identification potential, whereas raw lab results are generally
less sensitive. Traditional DP-SGD enforces privacy protection on all features
in one sample, leading to excessive noise injection and significant utility
degradation. We propose FusionDP, a two-step framework that enhances model
utility under feature-level differential privacy. First, FusionDP leverages
large foundation models to impute sensitive features given non-sensitive
features, treating them as external priors that provide high-quality estimates
of sensitive attributes without accessing the true values during model
training. Second, we introduce a modified DP-SGD algorithm that trains models
on both original and imputed features while formally preserving the privacy of
the original sensitive features. We evaluate FusionDP on two modalities: a
sepsis prediction task on tabular data from PhysioNet and a clinical note
classification task from MIMIC-III. By comparing against privacy-preserving
baselines, our results show that FusionDP significantly improves model
performance while maintaining rigorous feature-level privacy, demonstrating the
potential of foundation model-driven imputation to enhance the privacy-utility
trade-off for various modalities.

Abstract: Evolving borrower behaviors, shifting economic conditions, and changing
regulatory landscapes continuously reshape the data distributions underlying
modern credit-scoring systems. Conventional explainability techniques, such as
SHAP, assume static data and fixed background distributions, making their
explanations unstable and potentially unfair when concept drift occurs. This
study addresses that challenge by developing adaptive explanation frameworks
that recalibrate interpretability and fairness in dynamically evolving credit
models. Using a multi-year credit dataset, we integrate predictive modeling via
XGBoost with three adaptive SHAP variants: (A) per-slice explanation
reweighting that adjusts for feature distribution shifts, (B) drift-aware SHAP
rebaselining with sliding-window background samples, and (C) online surrogate
calibration using incremental Ridge regression. Each method is benchmarked
against static SHAP explanations using metrics of predictive performance (AUC,
F1), directional and rank stability (cosine, Kendall tau), and fairness
(demographic parity and recalibration). Results show that adaptive methods,
particularly rebaselined and surrogate-based explanations, substantially
improve temporal stability and reduce disparate impact across demographic
groups without degrading predictive accuracy. Robustness tests, including
counterfactual perturbations, background sensitivity analysis, and
proxy-variable detection, confirm the resilience of adaptive explanations under
real-world drift conditions. These findings establish adaptive explainability
as a practical mechanism for sustaining transparency, accountability, and
ethical reliability in data-driven credit systems, and more broadly, in any
domain where decision models evolve with population change.

Abstract: Reasoning language models perform well on complex tasks but are costly to
deploy due to their size and long reasoning traces. We propose a routing
approach that assigns each problem to the smallest model likely to solve it,
reducing compute without sacrificing accuracy. Using intermediate
representations from s1.1-32B, we train lightweight predictors of problem
difficulty or model correctness to guide routing across a pool of reasoning
models. On diverse math benchmarks, routing improves efficiency over random
assignment and matches s1.1-32B's performance while using significantly less
compute. Our results demonstrate that difficulty-aware routing is effective for
cost-efficient deployment of reasoning models.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Adaptive batch size methods aim to accelerate neural network training, but
existing approaches apply identical adaptation strategies across all
architectures, assuming a one-size-fits-all solution. We introduce DEBA
(Dynamic Efficient Batch Adaptation), an adaptive batch scheduler that monitors
gradient variance, gradient norm variation and loss variation to guide batch
size adaptations. Through systematic evaluation across six architectures
(ResNet-18/50, DenseNet-121, EfficientNet-B0, MobileNet-V3, ViT-B16) on
CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, with five random seeds per configuration, we
demonstrate that the architecture fundamentally determines adaptation efficacy.
Our findings reveal that: (1) lightweight and medium-depth architectures
(MobileNet-V3, DenseNet-121, EfficientNet-B0) achieve a 45-62% training speedup
with simultaneous accuracy improvements of 1-7%; (2) shallow residual networks
(ResNet-18) show consistent gains of +2.4 - 4.0% in accuracy, 36 - 43% in
speedup, while deep residual networks (ResNet-50) exhibit high variance and
occasional degradation; (3) already-stable architectures (ViT-B16) show minimal
speedup (6%) despite maintaining accuracy, indicating that adaptation benefits
vary with baseline optimization characteristics. We introduce a baseline
characterization framework using gradient stability metrics (stability score,
gradient norm variation) that predicts which architectures will benefit from
adaptive scheduling. Our ablation studies reveal critical design choices often
overlooked in prior work: sliding window statistics (vs. full history) and
sufficient cooldown periods (5+ epochs) between adaptations are essential for
success. This work challenges the prevailing assumption that adaptive methods
generalize across architectures and provides the first systematic evidence that
batch size adaptation requires an architecture-aware design.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks learn on graph-structured data by iteratively
aggregating local neighborhood information. While this local message passing
paradigm imparts a powerful inductive bias and exploits graph sparsity, it also
yields three key challenges: (i) oversquashing of long-range information, (ii)
oversmoothing of node representations, and (iii) limited expressive power. In
this work we inject randomized global embeddings of node features, which we
term \textit{Sketched Random Features}, into standard GNNs, enabling them to
efficiently capture long-range dependencies. The embeddings are unique,
distance-sensitive, and topology-agnostic -- properties which we analytically
and empirically show alleviate the aforementioned limitations when injected
into GNNs. Experimental results on real-world graph learning tasks confirm that
this strategy consistently improves performance over baseline GNNs, offering
both a standalone solution and a complementary enhancement to existing
techniques such as graph positional encodings. Our source code is available at

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Transitioning from offline to online reinforcement learning (RL) poses
critical challenges due to distributional shifts between the fixed behavior
policy in the offline dataset and the evolving policy during online learning.
Although this issue is widely recognized, few methods attempt to explicitly
assess or utilize the distributional structure of the offline data itself,
leaving a research gap in adapting learning strategies to different types of
samples. To address this challenge, we propose an innovative method,
Energy-Guided Diffusion Stratification (StratDiff), which facilitates smoother
transitions in offline-to-online RL. StratDiff deploys a diffusion model to
learn prior knowledge from the offline dataset. It then refines this knowledge
through energy-based functions to improve policy imitation and generate
offline-like actions during online fine-tuning. The KL divergence between the
generated action and the corresponding sampled action is computed for each
sample and used to stratify the training batch into offline-like and
online-like subsets. Offline-like samples are updated using offline objectives,
while online-like samples follow online learning strategies. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of StratDiff by integrating it with off-the-shelf methods Cal-QL
and IQL. Extensive empirical evaluations on D4RL benchmarks show that StratDiff
significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving enhanced adaptability and
more stable performance across diverse RL settings.

Abstract: Causal structure learning has long been the central task of inferring causal
insights from data. Despite the abundance of real-world processes exhibiting
higher-order mechanisms, however, an explicit treatment of interactions in
causal discovery has received little attention. In this work, we focus on
extending the causal additive model (CAM) to additive models with higher-order
interactions. This second level of modularity we introduce to the structure
learning problem is most easily represented by a directed acyclic hypergraph
which extends the DAG. We introduce the necessary definitions and theoretical
tools to handle the novel structure we introduce and then provide
identifiability results for the hyper DAG, extending the typical Markov
equivalence classes. We next provide insights into why learning the more
complex hypergraph structure may actually lead to better empirical results. In
particular, more restrictive assumptions like CAM correspond to easier-to-learn
hyper DAGs and better finite sample complexity. We finally develop an extension
of the greedy CAM algorithm which can handle the more complex hyper DAG search
space and demonstrate its empirical usefulness in synthetic experiments.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Deep Q-Networks (DQNs) estimate future returns by learning from transitions
sampled from a replay buffer. However, the target updates in DQN often rely on
next states generated by actions from past, potentially suboptimal, policy. As
a result, these states may not provide informative learning signals, causing
high variance into the update process. This issue is exacerbated when the
sampled transitions are poorly aligned with the agent's current policy. To
address this limitation, we propose the Successor-state Aggregation Deep
Q-Network (SADQ), which explicitly models environment dynamics using a
stochastic transition model. SADQ integrates successor-state distributions into
the Q-value estimation process, enabling more stable and policy-aligned value
updates. Additionally, it explores a more efficient action selection strategy
with the modeled transition structure. We provide theoretical guarantees that
SADQ maintains unbiased value estimates while reducing training variance. Our
extensive empirical results across standard RL benchmarks and real-world
vector-based control tasks demonstrate that SADQ consistently outperforms DQN
variants in both stability and learning efficiency.

Abstract: Social and collaborative platforms emit multivariate time-series traces in
which early interactions-such as views, likes, or downloads-are followed,
sometimes months or years later, by higher impact like citations, sales, or
reviews. We formalize this setting as Lead-Lag Forecasting (LLF): given an
early usage channel (the lead), predict a correlated but temporally shifted
outcome channel (the lag). Despite the ubiquity of such patterns, LLF has not
been treated as a unified forecasting problem within the time-series community,
largely due to the absence of standardized datasets. To anchor research in LLF,
here we present two high-volume benchmark datasets-arXiv (accesses -> citations
of 2.3M papers) and GitHub (pushes/stars -> forks of 3M repositories)-and
outline additional domains with analogous lead-lag dynamics, including
Wikipedia (page views -> edits), Spotify (streams -> concert attendance),
e-commerce (click-throughs -> purchases), and LinkedIn profile (views ->
messages). Our datasets provide ideal testbeds for lead-lag forecasting, by
capturing long-horizon dynamics across years, spanning the full spectrum of
outcomes, and avoiding survivorship bias in sampling. We documented all
technical details of data curation and cleaning, verified the presence of
lead-lag dynamics through statistical and classification tests, and benchmarked
parametric and non-parametric baselines for regression. Our study establishes
LLF as a novel forecasting paradigm and lays an empirical foundation for its
systematic exploration in social and usage data. Our data portal with downloads

Abstract: Decomposition is a proven way to shrink deep networks without changing I/O.
We bring this idea to hyperdimensional computing (HDC), where footprint cuts
usually shrink the feature axis and erode concentration and robustness. Prior
HDC decompositions decode via fixed atomic hypervectors, which are ill-suited
for compressing learned class prototypes. We introduce DecoHD, which learns
directly in a decomposed HDC parameterization: a small, shared set of per-layer
channels with multiplicative binding across layers and bundling at the end,
yielding a large representational space from compact factors. DecoHD compresses
along the class axis via a lightweight bundling head while preserving native
bind-bundle-score; training is end-to-end, and inference remains pure HDC,
aligning with in/near-memory accelerators. In evaluation, DecoHD attains
extreme memory savings with only minor accuracy degradation under tight
deployment budgets. On average it stays within about 0.1-0.15% of a strong
non-reduced HDC baseline (worst case 5.7%), is more robust to random bit-flip
noise, reaches its accuracy plateau with up to ~97% fewer trainable parameters,
and -- in hardware -- delivers roughly 277x/35x energy/speed gains over a CPU
(AMD Ryzen 9 9950X), 13.5x/3.7x over a GPU (NVIDIA RTX 4090), and 2.0x/2.4x

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Inferring sociodemographic attributes from mobility data could help
transportation planners better leverage passively collected datasets, but this
task remains difficult due to weak and inconsistent relationships between
mobility patterns and sociodemographic traits, as well as limited
generalization across contexts. We address these challenges from three angles.
First, to improve predictive accuracy while retaining interpretability, we
introduce a behaviorally grounded set of higher-order mobility descriptors
based on directed mobility graphs. These features capture structured patterns
in trip sequences, travel modes, and social co-travel, and significantly
improve prediction of age, gender, income, and household structure over
baselines features. Second, we introduce metrics and visual diagnostic tools
that encourage evenness between model confidence and accuracy, enabling
planners to quantify uncertainty. Third, to improve generalization and sample
efficiency, we develop a multitask learning framework that jointly predicts
multiple sociodemographic attributes from a shared representation. This
approach outperforms single-task models, particularly when training data are
limited or when applying models across different time periods (i.e., when the
test set distribution differs from the training set).

Abstract: We introduce and formalize the Synthetic Dataset Quality Estimation (SynQuE)
problem: ranking synthetic datasets by their expected real-world task
performance using only limited unannotated real data. This addresses a critical
and open challenge where data is scarce due to collection costs or privacy
constraints. We establish the first comprehensive benchmarks for this problem
by introducing and evaluating proxy metrics that choose synthetic data for
training to maximize task performance on real data. We introduce the first
proxy metrics for SynQuE by adapting distribution and diversity-based distance
measures to our context via embedding models. To address the shortcomings of
these metrics on complex planning tasks, we propose LENS, a novel proxy that
leverages large language model reasoning. Our results show that SynQuE proxies
correlate with real task performance across diverse tasks, including sentiment
analysis, Text2SQL, web navigation, and image classification, with LENS
consistently outperforming others on complex tasks by capturing nuanced
characteristics. For instance, on text-to-SQL parsing, training on the top-3
synthetic datasets selected via SynQuE proxies can raise accuracy from 30.4% to
38.4 (+8.1)% on average compared to selecting data indiscriminately. This work
establishes SynQuE as a practical framework for synthetic data selection under
real-data scarcity and motivates future research on foundation model-based data
characterization and fine-grained data selection.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Hyperdimensional computing (HDC) suits memory, energy, and
reliability-constrained systems, yet the standard "one prototype per class"
design requires $O(CD)$ memory (with $C$ classes and dimensionality $D$). Prior
compaction reduces $D$ (feature axis), improving storage/compute but weakening
robustness. We introduce LogHD, a logarithmic class-axis reduction that
replaces the $C$ per-class prototypes with $n\!\approx\!\lceil\log_k C\rceil$
bundle hypervectors (alphabet size $k$) and decodes in an $n$-dimensional
activation space, cutting memory to $O(D\log_k C)$ while preserving $D$. LogHD
uses a capacity-aware codebook and profile-based decoding, and composes with
feature-axis sparsification. Across datasets and injected bit flips, LogHD
attains competitive accuracy with smaller models and higher resilience at
matched memory. Under equal memory, it sustains target accuracy at roughly
$2.5$-$3.0\times$ higher bit-flip rates than feature-axis compression; an ASIC
instantiation delivers $498\times$ energy efficiency and $62.6\times$ speedup
over an AMD Ryzen 9 9950X and $24.3\times$/$6.58\times$ over an NVIDIA RTX
4090, and is $4.06\times$ more energy-efficient and $2.19\times$ faster than a

Abstract: We address the problem of quickest change detection in Markov processes with
unknown transition kernels. The key idea is to learn the conditional score
$\nabla_{\mathbf{y}} \log p(\mathbf{y}|\mathbf{x})$ directly from sample pairs
$( \mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})$, where both $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{y}$ are
high-dimensional data generated by the same transition kernel. In this way, we
avoid explicit likelihood evaluation and provide a practical way to learn the
transition dynamics. Based on this estimation, we develop a score-based CUSUM
procedure that uses conditional Hyvarinen score differences to detect changes
in the kernel. To ensure bounded increments, we propose a truncated version of
the statistic. With Hoeffding's inequality for uniformly ergodic Markov
processes, we prove exponential lower bounds on the mean time to false alarm.
We also prove asymptotic upper bounds on detection delay. These results give
both theoretical guarantees and practical feasibility for score-based detection
in high-dimensional Markov models.

Abstract: The need to remove specific student data from cognitive diagnosis (CD) models
has become a pressing requirement, driven by users' growing assertion of their
"right to be forgotten". However, existing CD models are largely designed
without privacy considerations and lack effective data unlearning mechanisms.
Directly applying general purpose unlearning algorithms is suboptimal, as they
struggle to balance unlearning completeness, model utility, and efficiency when
confronted with the unique heterogeneous structure of CD models. To address
this, our paper presents the first systematic study of the data unlearning
problem for CD models, proposing a novel and efficient algorithm: hierarchical
importanceguided forgetting (HIF). Our key insight is that parameter importance
in CD models exhibits distinct layer wise characteristics. HIF leverages this
via an innovative smoothing mechanism that combines individual and layer, level
importance, enabling a more precise distinction of parameters associated with
the data to be unlearned. Experiments on three real world datasets show that
HIF significantly outperforms baselines on key metrics, offering the first
effective solution for CD models to respond to user data removal requests and
for deploying high-performance, privacy preserving AI systems

Abstract: An important question in deep learning is how higher-order optimization
methods affect generalization. In this work, we analyze a stochastic
Gauss-Newton (SGN) method with Levenberg-Marquardt damping and mini-batch
sampling for training overparameterized deep neural networks with smooth
activations in a regression setting. Our theoretical contributions are twofold.
First, we establish finite-time convergence bounds via a variable-metric
analysis in parameter space, with explicit dependencies on the batch size,
network width and depth. Second, we derive non-asymptotic generalization bounds
for SGN using uniform stability in the overparameterized regime, characterizing
the impact of curvature, batch size, and overparameterization on generalization
performance. Our theoretical results identify a favorable generalization regime
for SGN in which a larger minimum eigenvalue of the Gauss-Newton matrix along
the optimization path yields tighter stability bounds.

Abstract: Since its emergence, SARS-CoV-2 has demonstrated a rapid and unpredictable
evolutionary trajectory, characterized by the continual emergence of
immune-evasive variants. This poses persistent challenges to public health and
vaccine development.
  While large-scale generative pre-trained transformers (GPTs) have
revolutionized the modeling of sequential data, their direct applications to
noisy viral genomic sequences are limited. In this paper, we introduce
PETRA(Pretrained Evolutionary TRAnsformer), a novel transformer approach based
on evolutionary trajectories derived from phylogenetic trees rather than raw
RNA sequences. This method effectively mitigates sequencing noise and captures
the hierarchical structure of viral evolution.
  With a weighted training framework to address substantial geographical and
temporal imbalances in global sequence data, PETRA excels in predicting future
SARS-CoV-2 mutations, achieving a weighted recall@1 of 9.45% for nucleotide
mutations and 17.10\% for spike amino-acid mutations, compared to 0.49% and
6.64% respectively for the best baseline. PETRA also demonstrates its ability
to aid in the real-time mutation prediction of major clades like 24F(XEC) and
25A(LP.8.1). The code is open sourced on https://github.com/xz-keg/PETra

paths into graph structural priors, which provide unified structural
constraints for adapter weight allocation and path selection. Modular adapters
are embedded into different layers through low-rank mapping and a pluggable
mechanism, enabling efficient cross-task composition and reuse under prior
guidance. This mechanism not only improves parameter efficiency and training
stability but also alleviates path conflicts and redundant computation in
multi-task scenarios. Furthermore, experiments on hyperparameter sensitivity,
environmental sensitivity, and data sensitivity are conducted to systematically
analyze key factors such as routing temperature, gating thresholds, and
relation matrix regularization strength, verifying the consistency and superior
performance of the method under structural constraints. The results demonstrate
that the proposed framework significantly enhances task prediction accuracy,
adapter weight allocation precision, and overall computational efficiency while
maintaining model lightweight design, highlighting the synergistic advantages
of graph priors and modular mechanisms in composable fine-tuning.

Abstract: We introduce TwIST, a distributed training framework for efficient large
language model (LLM) sparsification. TwIST trains multiple subnetworks in
parallel, periodically aggregates their parameters, and resamples new
subnetworks during training. This process identifies high-quality subnetworks
("golden tickets") without requiring post-training procedures such as
calibration or Hessian-based recovery. As a result, TwIST enables zero-cost
pruning at deployment time while achieving perplexity competitive with
state-of-the-art post-training sparsification methods. The benefits are most
pronounced under aggressive sparsity (e.g., 50%+), where TwIST significantly
outperforms baseline methods; for example, reaching 23.14 PPL compared to 31.64
for the closest prior approach. Unlike unstructured pruning, TwIST produces
structured, dense matrices that offer practical inference speedups and memory
reductions on commodity hardware (e.g., CPUs) that do not support efficient
sparse computation. TwIST provides an efficient training-time path to
deployable sparse LLMs without additional fine-tuning or recovery overhead.

Abstract: The classification of diabetes and prediabetes by static glucose thresholds
obscures the pathophysiological dysglycemia heterogeneity, primarily driven by
insulin resistance (IR), beta-cell dysfunction, and incretin deficiency. This
review demonstrates that continuous glucose monitoring and wearable
technologies enable a paradigm shift towards non-invasive, dynamic metabolic
phenotyping. We show evidence that machine learning models can leverage
high-resolution glucose data from at-home, CGM-enabled oral glucose tolerance
tests to accurately predict gold-standard measures of muscle IR and beta-cell
function. This personalized characterization extends to real-world nutrition,
where an individual's unique postprandial glycemic response (PPGR) to
standardized meals, such as the relative glucose spike to potatoes versus
grapes, could serve as a biomarker for their metabolic subtype. Moreover,
integrating wearable data reveals that habitual diet, sleep, and physical
activity patterns, particularly their timing, are uniquely associated with
specific metabolic dysfunctions, informing precision lifestyle interventions.
The efficacy of dietary mitigators in attenuating PPGR is also shown to be
phenotype-dependent. Collectively, this evidence demonstrates that CGM can
deconstruct the complexity of early dysglycemia into distinct, actionable
subphenotypes. This approach moves beyond simple glycemic control, paving the
way for targeted nutritional, behavioral, and pharmacological strategies
tailored to an individual's core metabolic defects, thereby paving the way for
a new era of precision diabetes prevention.

Abstract: Network anomaly detection systems encounter several challenges with
traditional detectors trained offline. They become susceptible to concept drift
and new threats such as zero-day or polymorphic attacks. To address this
limitation, we propose a Ca$^{2+}$-modulated learning framework that draws
inspiration from astrocytic Ca$^{2+}$ signaling in the brain, where rapid,
context-sensitive adaptation enables robust information processing. Our
approach couples a multicellular astrocyte dynamics simulator with a deep
neural network (DNN). The simulator models astrocytic Ca$^{2+}$ dynamics
through three key mechanisms: IP$_3$-mediated Ca$^{2+}$ release, SERCA pump
uptake, and conductance-aware diffusion through gap junctions between cells.
Evaluation of our proposed network on CTU-13 (Neris) network traffic data
demonstrates the effectiveness of our biologically plausible approach. The
Ca$^{2+}$-gated model outperforms a matched baseline DNN, achieving up to
$\sim$98\% accuracy with reduced false positives and negatives across multiple
train/test splits. Importantly, this improved performance comes with negligible
runtime overhead once Ca$^{2+}$ trajectories are precomputed. While
demonstrated here for cybersecurity applications, this Ca$^{2+}$-modulated
learning framework offers a generic solution for streaming detection tasks that
require rapid, biologically grounded adaptation to evolving data patterns.

transforming and empowering the characterization and control of dynamic systems
in the engineering, physical, and biological sciences. These emerging modeling
paradigms require comparative metrics to evaluate a diverse set of scientific

that has contributed to the rapid advance of ML/AI algorithms in traditional

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved near-human performance across
diverse reasoning tasks, yet their deployment on resource-constrained
Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices remains impractical due to massive parameter
footprints and memory-intensive autoregressive decoding. While split computing
offers a promising solution by partitioning model execution between edge
devices and cloud servers, existing approaches fail to address the unique
challenges of autoregressive inference, particularly the iterative token
generation process and expanding key-value (KV) cache requirements. This work
introduces the first autoregressive-aware split computing framework designed
explicitly for LLM deployment on edge devices. Our approach makes three key
contributions. First, we develop one-point split compression (OPSC), a
mixed-precision quantization scheme that prevents out-of-memory failures by
strategically partitioning models into front-end and back-end segments with
different precision levels. Second, we propose a two-stage intermediate
compression pipeline that combines threshold splitting (TS) and token-wise
adaptive bit quantization (TAB-Q) to preserve accuracy-critical activations
while dramatically reducing communication overhead. Third, we formulate a
unified optimization framework that jointly selects optimal split points,
quantization settings, and sequence lengths to satisfy strict memory and
latency constraints. Extensive evaluations across diverse LLMs and hardware
platforms demonstrate superior performance compared to state-of-the-art
quantization methods, including SmoothQuant, OmniQuant, and Atom. The framework
achieves a 1.49 inference speedup and significant communication overhead
reduction while maintaining or improving model accuracy.

Abstract: Quantization plays a crucial role in accelerating the inference of
large-scale models, and rotational matrices have been shown to effectively
improve quantization performance by smoothing outliers. However, end-to-end
fine-tuning of rotational optimization algorithms incurs high computational
costs and is prone to overfitting. To address this challenge, we propose an
efficient distribution-aware rotational calibration method, DartQuant, which
reduces the complexity of rotational optimization by constraining the
distribution of the activations after rotation. This approach also effectively
reduces reliance on task-specific losses, thereby mitigating the risk of
overfitting. Additionally, we introduce the QR-Orth optimization scheme, which
replaces expensive alternating optimization with a more efficient solution. In
a variety of model quantization experiments, DartQuant demonstrates superior
performance. Compared to existing methods, it achieves 47$\times$ acceleration
and 10$\times$ memory savings for rotational optimization on a 70B model.
Furthermore, it is the first to successfully complete rotational calibration
for a 70B model on a single 3090 GPU, making quantization of large language
models feasible in resource-constrained environments. Code is available at

Abstract: Pediatric appendicitis remains one of the most common causes of acute
abdominal pain in children, and its diagnosis continues to challenge clinicians
due to overlapping symptoms and variable imaging quality. This study aims to
develop and evaluate a deep learning model based on a pretrained ResNet
architecture for automated detection of appendicitis from ultrasound images. We
used the Regensburg Pediatric Appendicitis Dataset, which includes ultrasound
scans, laboratory data, and clinical scores from pediatric patients admitted
with abdominal pain to Children Hospital. Hedwig in Regensburg, Germany. Each
subject had 1 to 15 ultrasound views covering the right lower quadrant,
appendix, lymph nodes, and related structures. For the image based
classification task, ResNet was fine tuned to distinguish appendicitis from
non-appendicitis cases. Images were preprocessed by normalization, resizing,
and augmentation to enhance generalization. The proposed ResNet model achieved
an overall accuracy of 93.44, precision of 91.53, and recall of 89.8,
demonstrating strong performance in identifying appendicitis across
heterogeneous ultrasound views. The model effectively learned discriminative
spatial features, overcoming challenges posed by low contrast, speckle noise,
and anatomical variability in pediatric imaging.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of the left atrium (LA) from cardiac MRI is critical
for guiding atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation and constructing biophysical
cardiac models. Manual delineation is time-consuming, observer-dependent, and
impractical for large-scale or time-sensitive clinical workflows. Deep learning
methods, particularly convolutional architectures, have recently demonstrated
superior performance in medical image segmentation tasks. In this study, we
applied the nnU-Net framework, an automated, self-configuring deep learning
segmentation architecture, to the Left Atrial Segmentation Challenge 2013
dataset. The dataset consists of thirty MRI scans with corresponding
expert-annotated masks. The nnU-Net model automatically adapted its
preprocessing, network configuration, and training pipeline to the
characteristics of the MRI data. Model performance was quantitatively evaluated
using the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), and qualitative results were
compared against expert segmentations. The proposed nnU?Net model achieved a
mean Dice score of 93.5, demonstrating high overlap with expert annotations and
outperforming several traditional segmentation approaches reported in previous
studies. The network exhibited robust generalization across variations in left
atrial shape, contrast, and image quality, accurately delineating both the
atrial body and proximal pulmonary veins.

Abstract: Filtered Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) search retrieves the closest
vectors for a query vector from a dataset. It enforces that a specified set of
discrete labels $S$ for the query must be included in the labels of each
retrieved vector. Existing graph-based methods typically incorporate filter
awareness by assigning fixed penalties or prioritizing nodes based on filter
satisfaction. However, since these methods use fixed, data in- dependent
penalties, they often fail to generalize across datasets with diverse label and
vector distributions. In this work, we propose a principled alternative that
learns the optimal trade-off between vector distance and filter match directly
from the data, rather than relying on fixed penalties. We formulate this as a
constrained linear optimization problem, deriving weights that better reflect
the underlying filter distribution and more effectively address the filtered
ANN search problem. These learned weights guide both the search process and
index construction, leading to graph structures that more effectively capture
the underlying filter distribution and filter semantics. Our experiments
demonstrate that adapting the distance function to the data significantly im-
proves accuracy by 5-10% over fixed-penalty methods, providing a more flexible
and generalizable framework for the filtered ANN search problem.

Abstract: With the rapid growth of graph-structured data in critical domains,
unsupervised graph-level anomaly detection (UGAD) has become a pivotal task.
UGAD seeks to identify entire graphs that deviate from normal behavioral
patterns. However, most Graph Neural Network (GNN) approaches implicitly assume
that the training set is clean, containing only normal graphs, which is rarely
true in practice. Even modest contamination by anomalous graphs can distort
learned representations and sharply degrade performance. To address this
challenge, we propose DeNoise, a robust UGAD framework explicitly designed for
contaminated training data. It jointly optimizes a graph-level encoder, an
attribute decoder, and a structure decoder via an adversarial objective to
learn noise-resistant embeddings. Further, DeNoise introduces an encoder
anchor-alignment denoising mechanism that fuses high-information node
embeddings from normal graphs into all graph embeddings, improving
representation quality while suppressing anomaly interference. A contrastive
learning component then compacts normal graph embeddings and repels anomalous
ones in the latent space. Extensive experiments on eight real-world datasets
demonstrate that DeNoise consistently learns reliable graph-level
representations under varying noise intensities and significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art UGAD baselines.

Abstract: This study introduces the Korean Tax Avoidance Panel (KoTaP), a long-term
panel dataset of non-financial firms listed on KOSPI and KOSDAQ between 2011
and 2024. After excluding financial firms, firms with non-December fiscal year
ends, capital impairment, and negative pre-tax income, the final dataset
consists of 12,653 firm-year observations from 1,754 firms. KoTaP is designed
to treat corporate tax avoidance as a predictor variable and link it to
multiple domains, including earnings management (accrual- and activity-based),
profitability (ROA, ROE, CFO, LOSS), stability (LEV, CUR, SIZE, PPE, AGE,
INVREC), growth (GRW, MB, TQ), and governance (BIG4, FORN, OWN). Tax avoidance
itself is measured using complementary indicators cash effective tax rate
(CETR), GAAP effective tax rate (GETR), and book-tax difference measures (TSTA,
TSDA) with adjustments to ensure interpretability. A key strength of KoTaP is
its balanced panel structure with standardized variables and its consistency
with international literature on the distribution and correlation of core
indicators. At the same time, it reflects distinctive institutional features of
Korean firms, such as concentrated ownership, high foreign shareholding, and
elevated liquidity ratios, providing both international comparability and
contextual uniqueness. KoTaP enables applications in benchmarking econometric
and deep learning models, external validity checks, and explainable AI
analyses. It further supports policy evaluation, audit planning, and investment
analysis, making it a critical open resource for accounting, finance, and
interdisciplinary research.

Abstract: Symbolic regression (SR) models complex systems by discovering mathematical
expressions that capture underlying relationships in observed data. However,
most SR methods prioritize minimizing prediction error over identifying the
governing equations, often producing overly complex or inaccurate expressions.
To address this, we present a decomposable SR method that generates
interpretable multivariate expressions leveraging transformer models, genetic
algorithms (GAs), and genetic programming (GP). In particular, our explainable
SR method distills a trained ``opaque'' regression model into mathematical
expressions that serve as explanations of its computed function. Our method
employs a Multi-Set Transformer to generate multiple univariate symbolic
skeletons that characterize how each variable influences the opaque model's
response. We then evaluate the generated skeletons' performance using a
GA-based approach to select a subset of high-quality candidates before
incrementally merging them via a GP-based cascade procedure that preserves
their original skeleton structure. The final multivariate skeletons undergo
coefficient optimization via a GA. We evaluated our method on problems with
controlled and varying degrees of noise, demonstrating lower or comparable
interpolation and extrapolation errors compared to two GP-based methods, three
neural SR methods, and a hybrid approach. Unlike them, our approach
consistently learned expressions that matched the original mathematical
structure.

Abstract: In recent years, end-to-end Large Language Model (LLM) technology has shown
substantial advantages across various domains. As critical system software and
infrastructure, compilers are responsible for transforming source code into
target code. While LLMs have been leveraged to assist in compiler development
and maintenance, their potential as an end-to-end compiler remains largely
unexplored. This paper explores the feasibility of LLM as a Compiler (LaaC) and
its future directions. We designed the CompilerEval dataset and framework
specifically to evaluate the capabilities of mainstream LLMs in source code
comprehension and assembly code generation. In the evaluation, we analyzed
various errors, explored multiple methods to improve LLM-generated code, and
evaluated cross-platform compilation capabilities. Experimental results
demonstrate that LLMs exhibit basic capabilities as compilers but currently
achieve low compilation success rates. By optimizing prompts, scaling up the
model, and incorporating reasoning methods, the quality of assembly code
generated by LLMs can be significantly enhanced. Based on these findings, we
maintain an optimistic outlook for LaaC and propose practical architectural
designs and future research directions. We believe that with targeted training,
knowledge-rich prompts, and specialized infrastructure, LaaC has the potential
to generate high-quality assembly code and drive a paradigm shift in the field
of compilation.

Abstract: Safe reinforcement learning (safe RL) aims to respect safety requirements
while optimizing long-term performance. In many practical applications,
however, the problem involves an infinite number of constraints, known as
semi-infinite safe RL (SI-safe RL). Such constraints typically appear when
safety conditions must be enforced across an entire continuous parameter space,
such as ensuring adequate resource distribution at every spatial location. In
this paper, we propose exchange policy optimization (EPO), an algorithmic
framework that achieves optimal policy performance and deterministic bounded
safety. EPO works by iteratively solving safe RL subproblems with finite
constraint sets and adaptively adjusting the active set through constraint
expansion and deletion. At each iteration, constraints with violations
exceeding the predefined tolerance are added to refine the policy, while those
with zero Lagrange multipliers are removed after the policy update. This
exchange rule prevents uncontrolled growth of the working set and supports
effective policy training. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that, under
mild assumptions, strategies trained via EPO achieve performance comparable to
optimal solutions with global constraint violations strictly remaining within a
prescribed bound.

Abstract: Access to trajectory data is a key requirement for developing and validating
Air Traffic Management (ATM) solutions, yet many secondary and regional
airports face severe data scarcity. This limits the applicability of machine
learning methods and the ability to perform large-scale simulations or
"what-if" analyses. In this paper, we investigate whether generative models
trained on data-rich airports can be efficiently adapted to data-scarce
airports using transfer learning. We adapt state-of-the-art diffusion- and
flow-matching-based architectures to the aviation domain and evaluate their
transferability between Zurich (source) and Dublin (target) landing trajectory
datasets. Models are pretrained on Zurich and fine-tuned on Dublin with varying
amounts of local data, ranging from 0% to 100%. Results show that
diffusion-based models achieve competitive performance with as little as 5% of
the Dublin data and reach baseline-level performance around 20%, consistently
outperforming models trained from scratch across metrics and visual
inspections. Latent flow matching and latent diffusion models also benefit from
pretraining, though with more variable gains, while flow matching models show
weaker generalization. Despite challenges in capturing rare trajectory
patterns, these findings demonstrate the potential of transfer learning to
substantially reduce data requirements for trajectory generation in ATM,
enabling realistic synthetic data generation even in environments with limited
historical records.

Abstract: This study proposes a Transformer-based longitudinal modeling method to
address challenges in clinical risk classification with heterogeneous
Electronic Health Record (EHR) data, including irregular temporal patterns,
large modality differences, and complex semantic structures. The method takes
multi-source medical features as input and employs a feature embedding layer to
achieve a unified representation of structured and unstructured data. A
learnable temporal encoding mechanism is introduced to capture dynamic
evolution under uneven sampling intervals. The core model adopts a multi-head
self-attention structure to perform global dependency modeling on longitudinal
sequences, enabling the aggregation of long-term trends and short-term
fluctuations across different temporal scales. To enhance semantic
representation, a semantic-weighted pooling module is designed to assign
adaptive importance to key medical events, improving the discriminative ability
of risk-related features. Finally, a linear mapping layer generates
individual-level risk scores. Experimental results show that the proposed model
outperforms traditional machine learning and temporal deep learning models in
accuracy, recall, precision, and F1-Score, achieving stable and precise risk
identification in multi-source heterogeneous EHR environments and providing an
efficient and reliable framework for clinical intelligent decision-making.

Abstract: Deep ensembles are a powerful tool in machine learning, improving both model
performance and uncertainty calibration. While ensembles are typically formed
by training and tuning models individually, evidence suggests that jointly
tuning the ensemble can lead to better performance. This paper investigates the
impact of jointly tuning weight decay, temperature scaling, and early stopping
on both predictive performance and uncertainty quantification. Additionally, we
propose a partially overlapping holdout strategy as a practical compromise
between enabling joint evaluation and maximizing the use of data for training.
Our results demonstrate that jointly tuning the ensemble generally matches or
improves performance, with significant variation in effect size across
different tasks and metrics. We highlight the trade-offs between individual and
joint optimization in deep ensemble training, with the overlapping holdout
strategy offering an attractive practical solution. We believe our findings
provide valuable insights and guidance for practitioners looking to optimize
deep ensemble models. Code is available at:

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) form the cornerstone of modern AI services,
supporting a wide range of applications, including autonomous driving,
chatbots, and recommendation systems. As models increase in size and
complexity, DNN workloads like training and inference tasks impose
unprecedented demands on distributed computing resources, making the accurate
prediction of runtime essential for optimizing development and resource
allocation. Traditional methods rely on additive computational unit models,
limiting their accuracy and generalizability. In contrast, graph-enhanced
modeling improves performance but significantly increases data collection
costs. Therefore, there is a critical need for a method that strikes a balance
between accuracy, generalizability, and the costs of data collection. To
address these challenges, we propose ScaleDL, a novel runtime prediction
framework that combines nonlinear layer-wise modeling with graph neural network
(GNN)-based cross-layer interaction mechanism, enabling accurate DNN runtime
prediction and hierarchical generalizability across different network
architectures. Additionally, we employ the D-optimal method to reduce data
collection costs. Experiments on the workloads of five popular DNN models prove
that ScaleDL enhances runtime prediction accuracy and generalizability,
achieving 6$\times$ lower MRE and 5$\times$ lower RMSE compared to baseline
models.

energy. Post-training quantization (PTQ) is a promising solution for efficient
deployment, yet achieving accurate W4A4 quantization remains an open challenge.
While most existing methods are designed for INT4 formats, the emergence of
MXFP4 -- a new FP4 format with various hardware support (NVIDIA, AMD, Intel)--
raises questions about the applicability of current techniques. In this work,
we establish a comprehensive benchmark of PTQ methods under the MXFP4 format.
Through systematic evaluation, we find that methods like GPTQ consistently
deliver strong performance, whereas rotation-based approaches, which are almost
used by all state-of-the-art approaches, suffer from severe incompatibility
with MXFP4. We further provide the first in-depth analysis of this conflict,
tracing its root to a fundamental mismatch between MXFP4's PoT (power-of-two)
block scaling and the redistribution of outlier energy via global rotation.
Building on this insight, we propose a simple yet effective block rotation
strategy that adapts rotation-based methods to MXFP4, leading to substantial
accuracy improvements across diverse LLMs. Our findings not only offer clear
guidance for practitioners but also set a foundation for advancing PTQ research
under emerging low-precision formats.

Abstract: The strong lottery ticket hypothesis (SLTH) conjectures that high-performing
subnetworks, called strong lottery tickets (SLTs), are hidden in randomly
initialized neural networks. Although recent theoretical studies have
established the SLTH across various neural architectures, the SLTH for
transformer architectures still lacks theoretical understanding. In particular,
the current theory of the SLTH does not yet account for the multi-head
attention (MHA) mechanism, a core component of transformers. To address this
gap, we introduce a theoretical analysis of the existence of SLTs within MHAs.
We prove that, if a randomly initialized MHA of $H$ heads and input dimension
$d$ has the hidden dimension $O(d\log(Hd^{3/2}))$ for the key and value, it
contains an SLT that approximates an arbitrary MHA with the same input
dimension with high probability. Furthermore, by leveraging this theory for
MHAs, we extend the SLTH to transformers without normalization layers. We
empirically validate our theoretical findings, demonstrating that the
approximation error between the SLT within a source model (MHA and transformer)
and an approximate target counterpart decreases exponentially by increasing the
hidden dimension of the source model.

Abstract: Recent advances in computational methods for designing biological sequences
have sparked the development of metrics to evaluate these methods performance
in terms of the fidelity of the designed sequences to a target distribution and
their attainment of desired properties. However, a single software library
implementing these metrics was lacking. In this work we introduce seqme, a
modular and highly extendable open-source Python library, containing
model-agnostic metrics for evaluating computational methods for biological
sequence design. seqme considers three groups of metrics: sequence-based,
embedding-based, and property-based, and is applicable to a wide range of
biological sequences: small molecules, DNA, ncRNA, mRNA, peptides and proteins.
The library offers a number of embedding and property models for biological
sequences, as well as diagnostics and visualization functions to inspect the
results. seqme can be used to evaluate both one-shot and iterative
computational design methods.

Abstract: Time series classification is a task of paramount importance, as this kind of
data often arises in safety-critical applications. However, it is typically
tackled with black-box deep learning methods, making it hard for humans to
understand the rationale behind their output. To take on this challenge, we
propose a novel approach, STELLE (Signal Temporal logic Embedding for
Logically-grounded Learning and Explanation), a neuro-symbolic framework that
unifies classification and explanation through direct embedding of trajectories
into a space of temporal logic concepts. By introducing a novel STL-inspired
kernel that maps raw time series to their alignment with predefined STL
formulae, our model jointly optimises accuracy and interpretability, as each
prediction is accompanied by the most relevant logical concepts that
characterise it. This yields (i) local explanations as human-readable STL
conditions justifying individual predictions, and (ii) global explanations as
class-characterising formulae. Experiments demonstrate that STELLE achieves
competitive accuracy while providing logically faithful explanations, validated
on diverse real-world benchmarks.

Abstract: Learning from human preferences is a cornerstone of aligning machine learning
models with subjective human judgments. Yet, collecting such preference data is
often costly and time-consuming, motivating the need for more efficient
learning paradigms. Two established approaches offer complementary advantages:
RLHF scales effectively to high-dimensional tasks such as LLM fine-tuning,
while PBO achieves greater sample efficiency through active querying. We
propose a hybrid framework that unifies RLHF's scalability with PBO's query
efficiency by integrating an acquisition-driven module into the RLHF pipeline,
thereby enabling active and sample-efficient preference gathering. We validate
the proposed approach on two representative domains: (i) high-dimensional
preference optimization and (ii) LLM fine-tuning. Experimental results
demonstrate consistent improvements in both sample efficiency and overall
performance across these tasks.

Abstract: Differentially private in-context learning (DP-ICL) has recently become an
active research topic due to the inherent privacy risks of in-context learning.
However, existing approaches overlook a critical component of modern large
language model (LLM) pipelines: the similarity search used to retrieve relevant
context data. In this work, we introduce a DP framework for in-context learning
that integrates nearest neighbor search of relevant examples in a privacy-aware
manner. Our method outperforms existing baselines by a substantial margin
across all evaluated benchmarks, achieving more favorable privacy-utility
trade-offs. To achieve this, we employ nearest neighbor retrieval from a
database of context data, combined with a privacy filter that tracks the
cumulative privacy cost of selected samples to ensure adherence to a central
differential privacy budget. Experimental results on text classification and
document question answering show a clear advantage of the proposed method over
existing baselines.

Abstract: Dynamic Bayesian networks (DBNs) are increasingly used in healthcare due to
their ability to model complex temporal relationships in patient data while
maintaining interpretability, an essential feature for clinical
decision-making. However, existing approaches to handling missing data in
longitudinal clinical datasets are largely derived from static Bayesian
networks literature, failing to properly account for the temporal nature of the
data. This gap limits the ability to quantify uncertainty over time, which is
particularly critical in settings such as intensive care, where understanding
the temporal dynamics is fundamental for model trustworthiness and
applicability across diverse patient groups. Despite the potential of DBNs, a
full Bayesian framework that integrates missing data handling remains
underdeveloped. In this work, we propose a novel Gibbs sampling-based method
for learning DBNs from incomplete data. Our method treats each missing value as
an unknown parameter following a Gaussian distribution. At each iteration, the
unobserved values are sampled from their full conditional distributions,
allowing for principled imputation and uncertainty estimation. We evaluate our
method on both simulated datasets and real-world intensive care data from
critically ill patients. Compared to standard model-agnostic techniques such as
MICE, our Bayesian approach demonstrates superior reconstruction accuracy and
convergence properties. These results highlight the clinical relevance of
incorporating full Bayesian inference in temporal models, providing more
reliable imputations and offering deeper insight into model behavior. Our
approach supports safer and more informed clinical decision-making,
particularly in settings where missing data are frequent and potentially
impactful.

Abstract: Deep learning models achieve strong performance across various domains but
often rely on spurious correlations, making them vulnerable to distribution
shifts. This issue is particularly severe in subpopulation shift scenarios,
where models struggle in underrepresented groups. While existing methods have
made progress in mitigating this issue, their performance gains are still
constrained. They lack a rigorous theoretical framework connecting the
embedding space representations with worst-group error. To address this
limitation, we propose Spurious Correlation-Aware Embedding Regularization for
Worst-Group Robustness (SCER), a novel approach that directly regularizes
feature representations to suppress spurious cues. We show theoretically that
worst-group error is influenced by how strongly the classifier relies on
spurious versus core directions, identified from differences in group-wise mean
embeddings across domains and classes. By imposing theoretical constraints at
the embedding level, SCER encourages models to focus on core features while
reducing sensitivity to spurious patterns. Through systematic evaluation on
multiple vision and language, we show that SCER outperforms prior
state-of-the-art studies in worst-group accuracy. Our code is available at

Abstract: Accurate uncertainty quantification (UQ) in Large Language Models (LLMs) is
critical for trustworthy deployment. While real-world language is inherently
ambiguous, reflecting aleatoric uncertainty, existing UQ methods are typically
benchmarked against tasks with no ambiguity. In this work, we demonstrate that
while current uncertainty estimators perform well under the restrictive
assumption of no ambiguity, they degrade to close-to-random performance on
ambiguous data. To this end, we introduce MAQA* and AmbigQA*, the first
ambiguous question-answering (QA) datasets equipped with ground-truth answer
distributions estimated from factual co-occurrence. We find this performance
deterioration to be consistent across different estimation paradigms: using the
predictive distribution itself, internal representations throughout the model,
and an ensemble of models. We show that this phenomenon can be theoretically
explained, revealing that predictive-distribution and ensemble-based estimators
are fundamentally limited under ambiguity. Overall, our study reveals a key
shortcoming of current UQ methods for LLMs and motivates a rethinking of
current modeling paradigms.

Abstract: A formal link between regression and classification has been tenuous. Even
though the margin maximization term $\|w\|$ is used in support vector
regression, it has at best been justified as a regularizer. We show that a
regression problem with $M$ samples lying on a hyperplane has a one-to-one
equivalence with a linearly separable classification task with $2M$ samples. We
show that margin maximization on the equivalent classification task leads to a
different regression formulation than traditionally used. Using the
equivalence, we demonstrate a ``regressability'' measure, that can be used to
estimate the difficulty of regressing a dataset, without needing to first learn
a model for it. We use the equivalence to train neural networks to learn a
linearizing map, that transforms input variables into a space where a linear
regressor is adequate.

Abstract: Time series forecasting is essential across domains from finance to supply
chain management. This paper introduces ForecastGAN, a novel decomposition
based adversarial framework addressing limitations in existing approaches for
multi-horizon predictions. Although transformer models excel in long-term
forecasting, they often underperform in short-term scenarios and typically
ignore categorical features. ForecastGAN operates through three integrated
modules: a Decomposition Module that extracts seasonality and trend components;
a Model Selection Module that identifies optimal neural network configurations
based on forecasting horizon; and an Adversarial Training Module that enhances
prediction robustness through Conditional Generative Adversarial Network
training. Unlike conventional approaches, ForecastGAN effectively integrates
both numerical and categorical features. We validate our framework on eleven
benchmark multivariate time series datasets that span various forecasting
horizons. The results show that ForecastGAN consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art transformer models for short-term forecasting while remaining
competitive for long-term horizons. This research establishes a more
generalizable approach to time series forecasting that adapts to specific
contexts while maintaining strong performance across diverse data
characteristics without extensive hyperparameter tuning.

Abstract: Heavy-tailed noise has attracted growing attention in nonconvex stochastic
optimization, as numerous empirical studies suggest it offers a more realistic
assumption than standard bounded variance assumption. In this work, we
investigate nonconvex-PL minimax optimization under heavy-tailed gradient noise
in federated learning. We propose two novel algorithms: Fed-NSGDA-M, which
integrates normalized gradients, and FedMuon-DA, which leverages the Muon
optimizer for local updates. Both algorithms are designed to effectively
address heavy-tailed noise in federated minimax optimization, under a milder
condition. We theoretically establish that both algorithms achieve a
convergence rate of $O({1}/{(TNp)^{\frac{s-1}{2s}}})$. To the best of our
knowledge, these are the first federated minimax optimization algorithms with
rigorous theoretical guarantees under heavy-tailed noise. Extensive experiments
further validate their effectiveness.

Abstract: Market generators using deep generative models have shown promise for

assessment. We propose a Time-series Neural Causal Model VAE (TNCM-VAE) that
combines variational autoencoders with structural causal models to generate
counterfactual financial time series while preserving both temporal
dependencies and causal relationships. Our approach enforces causal constraints
through directed acyclic graphs in the decoder architecture and employs the
causal Wasserstein distance for training. We validate our method on synthetic
autoregressive models inspired by the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, demonstrating
superior performance in counterfactual probability estimation with L1 distances
as low as 0.03-0.10 compared to ground truth. The model enables financial
stress testing, scenario analysis, and enhanced backtesting by generating
plausible counterfactual market trajectories that respect underlying causal
mechanisms.

We present SynthKGQA, a framework for generating high-quality synthetic

the full set of ground-truth facts in the KG to reason over each question. We
show how, in addition to enabling more informative benchmarking of KG
retrievers, the data produced with SynthKGQA also allows us to train better
models. We apply SynthKGQA to Wikidata to generate GTSQA, a new dataset
designed to test zero-shot generalization abilities of KG retrievers with
respect to unseen graph structures and relation types, and benchmark popular

Abstract: Parameter-efficient training, based on low-rank optimization, has become a
highly successful tool for fine-tuning large deep-learning models. However,
these methods fail at low-rank pre-training tasks where maintaining the
low-rank structure and the objective remains a challenging task. We propose the
Quadratic Reweighted Rank Regularizer dubbed Q3R, which leads to a novel
low-rank inducing training strategy inspired by the iteratively reweighted
least squares (IRLS) framework. Q3R is based on a quadratic regularizer term
which majorizes a smoothed log determinant serving as rank surrogate objective.
Unlike other low-rank training techniques, Q3R is able to train weight matrices
with prescribed, low target ranks of models that achieve comparable predictive
performance as dense models, with small computational overhead, while remaining
fully compatible with existing architectures. For example, we demonstrated one
experiment where we are able to truncate $60\%$ and $80\%$ of the parameters of
a ViT-Tiny model with $~1.3\%$ and $~4\%$ accuracy drop in CIFAR-10 performance
respectively. The efficacy of Q3R is confirmed on Transformers across both
image and language tasks, including for low-rank fine-tuning.

Abstract: Neural networks are widely used for image-related tasks but typically demand
considerable computing power. Once a network has been trained, however, its
memory- and compute-footprint can be reduced by compression. In this work, we
focus on compression through tensorization and low-rank representations.
Whereas classical approaches search for a low-rank approximation by minimizing
an isotropic norm such as the Frobenius norm in weight-space, we use
data-informed norms that measure the error in function space. Concretely, we
minimize the change in the layer's output distribution, which can be expressed
as $\lVert (W - \widetilde{W}) \Sigma^{1/2}\rVert_F$ where $\Sigma^{1/2}$ is
the square root of the covariance matrix of the layer's input and $W$,
$\widetilde{W}$ are the original and compressed weights. We propose new
alternating least square algorithms for the two most common tensor
decompositions (Tucker-2 and CPD) that directly optimize the new norm. Unlike
conventional compression pipelines, which almost always require
post-compression fine-tuning, our data-informed approach often achieves
competitive accuracy without any fine-tuning. We further show that the same
covariance-based norm can be transferred from one dataset to another with only
a minor accuracy drop, enabling compression even when the original training
dataset is unavailable. Experiments on several CNN architectures (ResNet-18/50,
and GoogLeNet) and datasets (ImageNet, FGVC-Aircraft, Cifar10, and Cifar100)
confirm the advantages of the proposed method.

Abstract: Algorithmic fairness has grown rapidly as a research area, yet key concepts
remain unsettled, especially in criminal justice. We review group, individual,
and process fairness and map the conditions under which they conflict. We then
develop a simple modification to standard group fairness. Rather than exact
parity across protected groups, we minimize a weighted error loss while keeping
differences in false negative rates within a small tolerance. This makes
solutions easier to find, can raise predictive accuracy, and surfaces the
ethical choice of error costs. We situate this proposal within three classes of
critique: biased and incomplete data, latent affirmative action, and the
explosion of subgroup constraints. Finally, we offer a practical framework for
deployment in public decision systems built on three pillars: need-based
decisions, Transparency and accountability, and narrowly tailored definitions
and solutions. Together, these elements link technical design to legitimacy and
provide actionable guidance for agencies that use risk assessment and related
tools.

Abstract: The phenomenon of linear mode connectivity (LMC) links several aspects of
deep learning, including training stability under noisy stochastic gradients,
the smoothness and generalization of local minima (basins), the similarity and
functional diversity of sampled models, and architectural effects on data
processing. In this work, we experimentally study LMC under data shifts and
identify conditions that mitigate their impact. We interpret data shifts as an
additional source of stochastic gradient noise, which can be reduced through
small learning rates and large batch sizes. These parameters influence whether
models converge to the same local minimum or to regions of the loss landscape
with varying smoothness and generalization. Although models sampled via LMC
tend to make similar errors more frequently than those converging to different
basins, the benefit of LMC lies in balancing training efficiency against the
gains achieved from larger, more diverse ensembles. Code and supplementary
materials will be made publicly available at https://github.com/DLR-KI/LMC in

consistently attains lower space-time $L^2$-error and maximum-in-time
$L^{2}$-error in space than CN-FEM, improving accuracy by roughly two orders of

all numerical experiments, we assume observability of only a few realistically
measurable plant variables. Compared to a purely system identification-based

Abstract: Reduced-order models (ROMs) can efficiently simulate high-dimensional

flexibility and generalization. We introduce a post hoc, model-agnostic

requires no modification to the underlying architecture or training procedure.
Using conformal prediction, our approach estimates statistical prediction
intervals for multiple components of the ROM pipeline: latent dynamics,
reconstruction, and end-to-end predictions. We demonstrate the method on a
latent space dynamical model for cloud microphysics, where it accurately
predicts the evolution of droplet-size distributions and quantifies uncertainty
across the ROM pipeline.

Abstract: In domains such as healthcare, finance, and e-commerce, the temporal dynamics
of relational data emerge from complex interactions-such as those between
patients and providers, or users and products across diverse categories. To be
broadly useful, models operating on these data must integrate long-range
spatial and temporal dependencies across diverse types of entities, while also
supporting multiple predictive tasks. However, existing graph models for
relational data primarily focus on spatial structure, treating temporal
information merely as a filtering constraint to exclude future events rather
than a modeling signal, and are typically designed for single-task prediction.
To address these gaps, we introduce a temporal subgraph sampler that enhances
global context by retrieving nodes beyond the immediate neighborhood to capture
temporally relevant relationships. In addition, we propose the Relational Graph
Perceiver (RGP), a graph transformer architecture for relational deep learning
that leverages a cross-attention-based latent bottleneck to efficiently
integrate information from both structural and temporal contexts. This latent
bottleneck integrates signals from different node and edge types into a common
latent space, enabling the model to build global context across the entire
relational system. RGP also incorporates a flexible cross-attention decoder
that supports joint learning across tasks with disjoint label spaces within a
single model. Experiments on RelBench, SALT, and CTU show that RGP delivers
state-of-the-art performance, offering a general and scalable solution for
relational deep learning with support for diverse predictive tasks.

our lack of key species data, especially occurrence data. Furthermore,
researchers have to contend with an accelerated speed at which new information
must be collected and processed due to anthropogenic activity. Publications
ranging from scientific papers to gray literature contain this crucial
information but their data are often not machine-readable, requiring extensive
human work to be retrieved. 2. We present the ARETE R package, an open-source
software aiming to automate data extraction of species occurrences powered by
large language models, namely using the chatGPT Application Programming
Interface. This R package integrates all steps of the data extraction and
validation process, from Optical Character Recognition to detection of outliers
and output in tabular format. Furthermore, we validate ARETE through systematic
comparison between what is modelled and the work of human annotators. 3. We
demonstrate the usefulness of the approach by comparing range maps produced
using GBIF data and with those automatically extracted for 100 species of
spiders. Newly extracted data allowed to expand the known Extent of Occurrence
by a mean three orders of magnitude, revealing new areas where the species were
found in the past, which mayhave important implications for spatial
conservation planning and extinction risk assessments. 4. ARETE allows faster
access to hitherto untapped occurrence data, a potential game changer in
projects requiring such data. Researchers will be able to better prioritize
resources, manually verifying selected species while maintaining automated
extraction for the majority. This workflow also allows predicting available
bibliographic data during project planning.

Abstract: We introduce Complexity as Advantage (CAA), a framework that defines the
complexity of a system relative to a family of observers. Instead of measuring
complexity as an intrinsic property, we evaluate how much predictive regret a
system induces for different observers attempting to model it. A system is
complex when it is easy for some observers and hard for others, creating an
information advantage. We show that this formulation unifies several notions of
emergent behavior, including multiscale entropy, predictive information, and
observer-dependent structure. The framework suggests that "interesting" systems
are those positioned to create differentiated regret across observers,
providing a quantitative grounding for why complexity can be functionally
valuable. We demonstrate the idea through simple dynamical models and discuss
implications for learning, evolution, and artificial agents.

Abstract: In this paper we study how transforming regular reinforcement learning
environments into goal-conditioned environments can let agents learn to solve
tasks autonomously and reward-free. We show that an agent can learn to solve
tasks by selecting its own goals in an environment-agnostic way, at training
times comparable to externally guided reinforcement learning. Our method is
independent of the underlying off-policy learning algorithm. Since our method
is environment-agnostic, the agent does not value any goals higher than others,
leading to instability in performance for individual goals. However, in our
experiments, we show that the average goal success rate improves and
stabilizes. An agent trained with this method can be instructed to seek any
observations made in the environment, enabling generic training of agents prior
to specific use cases.

Abstract: A common approach to mechanistic interpretability is to causally manipulate
model representations via targeted interventions in order to understand what
those representations encode. Here we ask whether such interventions create
out-of-distribution (divergent) representations, and whether this raises
concerns about how faithful their resulting explanations are to the target
model in its natural state. First, we demonstrate empirically that common
causal intervention techniques often do shift internal representations away
from the natural distribution of the target model. Then, we provide a
theoretical analysis of two classes of such divergences: `harmless' divergences
that occur in the null-space of the weights and from covariance within
behavioral decision boundaries, and `pernicious' divergences that activate
hidden network pathways and cause dormant behavioral changes. Finally, in an
effort to mitigate the pernicious cases, we modify the Counterfactual Latent
(CL) loss from Grant (2025) that regularizes interventions to remain closer to
the natural distributions, reducing the likelihood of harmful divergences while
preserving the interpretive power of interventions. Together, these results
highlight a path towards more reliable interpretability methods.

Abstract: This paper is concerned with probabilistic techniques for forecasting
dynamical systems described by partial differential equations (such as, for
example, the Navier-Stokes equations). In particular, it is investigating and
comparing various extensions to the flow matching paradigm that reduce the
number of sampling steps. In this regard, it compares direct distillation,
progressive distillation, adversarial diffusion distillation, Wasserstein GANs
and rectified flows. Moreover, experiments are conducted on a set of
challenging systems. In particular, we also address the challenge of directly
predicting 2D slices of large-scale 3D simulations, paving the way for
efficient inflow generation for solvers.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: A major bottleneck of standard auto-regressive large language models is that
their inference process is inherently sequential, resulting in very long and
costly inference times. To circumvent this, practitioners proposed a class of
language models called diffusion language models, of which the masked diffusion
model (MDM) is the most successful. The MDM is able to sample tokens
out-of-order and, ostensibly, many tokens at once and in parallel. However,
there is very limited rigorous understanding of how much parallel sampling
these models can perform without noticeable degradation in their sampling
performance. Prior work of Li and Cai obtained some preliminary bounds, but
these are not tight for many natural classes of distributions. In this work, we
give a new, exact characterization of the expected divergence between the true
distribution and the sampled distribution, for any distribution and any
unmasking schedule for the sampler, showing an elegant connection to the theory
of univariate function approximation.
  By leveraging this connection, we then attain a number of novel lower and
upper bounds for this problem. While the connection to function approximation
in principle gives the optimal unmasking schedule for any distribution, we show
that it is in general impossible to compete with it without strong a priori
knowledge of the distribution, even in seemingly benign settings. However, we
also demonstrate new upper bounds and new sampling schedules in terms of
well-studied information-theoretic properties of the base distribution, namely,
its total correlation and dual total correlation, which show that in some
natural settings, one can sample in $O(log n)$ steps without any visible loss
in performance, where $n$ is the total sequence length.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) offers new opportunities in machine learning,
particularly in addressing data privacy concerns. In contrast to conventional
event-based federated learning, time-triggered federated learning (TT-Fed), as
a general form of both asynchronous and synchronous FL, clusters users into
different tiers based on fixed time intervals. However, the FL network consists
of a growing number of user devices with limited wireless bandwidth,
consequently magnifying issues such as stragglers and communication overhead.
In this paper, we introduce adaptive model pruning to wireless TT-Fed systems
and study the problem of jointly optimizing the pruning ratio and bandwidth
allocation to minimize the training loss while ensuring minimal learning
latency. To answer this question, we perform convergence analysis on the
gradient l_2 norm of the TT-Fed model based on model pruning. Based on the
obtained convergence upper bound, a joint optimization problem of pruning ratio
and wireless bandwidth is formulated to minimize the model training loss under
a given delay threshold. Then, we derive closed-form solutions for wireless
bandwidth and pruning ratio using Karush-Kuhn-Tucker(KKT) conditions. The
simulation results show that model pruning could reduce the communication cost
by 40% while maintaining the model performance at the same level.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Extreme precipitation nowcasting demands high spatiotemporal fidelity and
extended lead times, yet existing approaches remain limited. Numerical Weather
Prediction (NWP) and its deep-learning emulations are too slow and coarse for
rapidly evolving convection, while extrapolation and purely data-driven models
suffer from error accumulation and excessive smoothing. Hybrid 2D radar-based
methods discard crucial vertical information, preventing accurate
reconstruction of height-dependent dynamics. We introduce a gray-box, fully
three-dimensional nowcasting framework that directly processes volumetric radar
reflectivity and couples physically constrained neural operators with
datadriven learning. The model learns vertically varying 3D advection fields
under a conservative advection operator, parameterizes spatially varying
diffusion, and introduces a Brownian-motion--inspired stochastic term to
represent unresolved motions. A residual branch captures small-scale convective
initiation and microphysical variability, while a diffusion-based stochastic
module estimates uncertainty. The framework achieves more accurate forecasts up
to three-hour lead time across precipitation regimes and ranked first in 57\%
of cases in a blind evaluation by 160 meteorologists. By restoring full 3D
dynamics with physical consistency, it offers a scalable and robust pathway for
skillful and reliable nowcasting of extreme precipitation.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: A fundamental challenge in developing general learning algorithms is their
tendency to forget past knowledge when adapting to new data. Addressing this
problem requires a principled understanding of forgetting; yet, despite decades
of study, no unified definition has emerged that provides insights into the
underlying dynamics of learning. We propose an algorithm- and task-agnostic
theory that characterises forgetting as a lack of self-consistency in a
learner's predictive distribution over future experiences, manifesting as a
loss of predictive information. Our theory naturally yields a general measure
of an algorithm's propensity to forget. To validate the theory, we design a
comprehensive set of experiments that span classification, regression,
generative modelling, and reinforcement learning. We empirically demonstrate
how forgetting is present across all learning settings and plays a significant
role in determining learning efficiency. Together, these results establish a
principled understanding of forgetting and lay the foundation for analysing and
improving the information retention capabilities of general learning
algorithms.

Abstract: This study evaluates a 40-item mathematics placement examination administered
to 198 students using a multi-method framework combining Classical Test Theory,
machine learning, and unsupervised clustering. Classical Test Theory analysis
reveals that 55\% of items achieve excellent discrimination ($D \geq 0.40$)
while 30\% demonstrate poor discrimination ($D < 0.20$) requiring replacement.
Question 6 (Graph Interpretation) emerges as the examination's most powerful
discriminator, achieving perfect discrimination ($D = 1.000$), highest ANOVA
F-statistic ($F = 4609.1$), and maximum Random Forest feature importance
(0.206), accounting for 20.6\% of predictive power. Machine learning algorithms
demonstrate exceptional performance, with Random Forest and Gradient Boosting
achieving 97.5\% and 96.0\% cross-validation accuracy. K-means clustering
identifies a natural binary competency structure with a boundary at 42.5\%,
diverging from the institutional threshold of 55\% and suggesting potential
overclassification into remedial categories. The two-cluster solution exhibits
exceptional stability (bootstrap ARI = 0.855) with perfect lower-cluster
purity. Convergent evidence across methods supports specific refinements:
replace poorly discriminating items, implement a two-stage assessment, and
integrate Random Forest predictions with transparency mechanisms. These
findings demonstrate that multi-method integration provides a robust empirical
foundation for evidence-based mathematics placement optimization.
