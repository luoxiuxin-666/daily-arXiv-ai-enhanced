Abstract: Planning has been a cornerstone of artificial intelligence for solving
complex problems, and recent progress in LLM-based multi-agent frameworks have
begun to extend this capability. However, the role of human-like memory within
these frameworks remains largely unexplored. Understanding how agents
coordinate through memory is critical for natural language planning, where
iterative reasoning, constraint tracking, and error correction drive the
success. Inspired by working memory model in cognitive psychology, we present
EvoMem, a multi-agent framework built on a dual-evolving memory mechanism. The
framework consists of three agents (Constraint Extractor, Verifier, and Actor)
and two memory modules: Constraint Memory (CMem), which evolves across queries
by storing task-specific rules and constraints while remains fixed within a
query, and Query-feedback Memory (QMem), which evolves within a query by
accumulating feedback across iterations for solution refinement. Both memory
modules are reset at the end of each query session. Evaluations on trip
planning, meeting planning, and calendar scheduling show consistent performance
improvements, highlighting the effectiveness of EvoMem. This success
underscores the importance of memory in enhancing multi-agent planning.

Abstract: One of the main challenges in managing traffic at multilane intersections is
ensuring smooth coordination between human-driven vehicles (HDVs) and connected
autonomous vehicles (CAVs). This paper presents a novel traffic signal control
framework that combines Graph Attention Networks (GAT) with Soft Actor-Critic
(SAC) reinforcement learning to address this challenge. GATs are used to model
the dynamic graph- structured nature of traffic flow to capture spatial and
temporal dependencies between lanes and signal phases. The proposed SAC is a
robust off-policy reinforcement learning algorithm that enables adaptive signal
control through entropy-optimized decision making. This design allows the
system to coordinate the signal timing and vehicle movement simultaneously with
objectives focused on minimizing travel time, enhancing performance, ensuring
safety, and improving fairness between HDVs and CAVs. The model is evaluated
using a SUMO-based simulation of a four-way intersection and incorporating
different traffic densities and CAV penetration rates. The experimental results
demonstrate the effectiveness of the GAT-SAC approach by achieving a 24.1%
reduction in average delay and up to 29.2% fewer traffic violations compared to
traditional methods. Additionally, the fairness ratio between HDVs and CAVs
improved to 1.59, indicating more equitable treatment across vehicle types.
These findings suggest that the GAT-SAC framework holds significant promise for
real-world deployment in mixed-autonomy traffic systems.

Abstract: We study the problem of learning multi-task, multi-agent policies for
cooperative, temporal objectives, under centralized training, decentralized
execution. In this setting, using automata to represent tasks enables the
decomposition of complex tasks into simpler sub-tasks that can be assigned to
agents. However, existing approaches remain sample-inefficient and are limited
to the single-task case. In this work, we present Automata-Conditioned
Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (ACC-MARL), a framework for
learning task-conditioned, decentralized team policies. We identify the main
challenges to ACC-MARL's feasibility in practice, propose solutions, and prove
the correctness of our approach. We further show that the value functions of
learned policies can be used to assign tasks optimally at test time.
Experiments show emergent task-aware, multi-step coordination among agents,
e.g., pressing a button to unlock a door, holding the door, and
short-circuiting tasks.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: No-regret learning dynamics play a central role in game theory, enabling
decentralized convergence to equilibrium for concepts such as Coarse Correlated
Equilibrium (CCE) or Correlated Equilibrium (CE). In this work, we improve the
convergence rate to CCE in general-sum Markov games, reducing it from the
previously best-known rate of $\mathcal{O}(\log^5 T / T)$ to a sharper
$\mathcal{O}(\log T / T)$. This matches the best known convergence rate for CE
in terms of $T$, number of iterations, while also improving the dependence on
the action set size from polynomial to polylogarithmic-yielding exponential
gains in high-dimensional settings. Our approach builds on recent advances in
adaptive step-size techniques for no-regret algorithms in normal-form games,
and extends them to the Markovian setting via a stage-wise scheme that adjusts
learning rates based on real-time feedback. We frame policy updates as an
instance of Optimistic Follow-the-Regularized-Leader (OFTRL), customized for
value-iteration-based learning. The resulting self-play algorithm achieves, to
our knowledge, the fastest known convergence rate to CCE in Markov games.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: In many real-life settings, algorithms play the role of assistants, while
humans ultimately make the final decision. Often, algorithms specifically act
as curators, narrowing down a wide range of options into a smaller subset that
the human picks between: consider content recommendation or chatbot responses
to questions with multiple valid answers. Crucially, humans may not know their
own preferences perfectly either, but instead may only have access to a noisy
sampling over preferences. Algorithms can assist humans by curating a smaller
subset of items, but must also face the challenge of misalignment: humans may
have different preferences from each other (and from the algorithm), and the
algorithm may not know the exact preferences of the human they are facing at
any point in time. In this paper, we model and theoretically study such a
setting. Specifically, we show instances where humans benefit by collaborating
with a misaligned algorithm. Surprisingly, we show that humans gain more
utility from a misaligned algorithm (which makes different mistakes) than from
an aligned algorithm. Next, we build on this result by studying what properties
of algorithms maximize human welfare when the goals could be either utilitarian
welfare or ensuring all humans benefit. We conclude by discussing implications
for designers of algorithmic tools and policymakers.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Training a team of agents from scratch in multi-agent reinforcement learning
(MARL) is highly inefficient, much like asking beginners to play a symphony
together without first practicing solo. Existing methods, such as offline or
transferable MARL, can ease this burden, but they still rely on costly
multi-agent data, which often becomes the bottleneck. In contrast, solo
experiences are far easier to obtain in many important scenarios, e.g.,
collaborative coding, household cooperation, and search-and-rescue. To unlock
their potential, we propose Solo-to-Collaborative RL (SoCo), a framework that
transfers solo knowledge into cooperative learning. SoCo first pretrains a
shared solo policy from solo demonstrations, then adapts it for cooperation
during multi-agent training through a policy fusion mechanism that combines an
MoE-like gating selector and an action editor. Experiments across diverse
cooperative tasks show that SoCo significantly boosts the training efficiency
and performance of backbone algorithms. These results demonstrate that solo
demonstrations provide a scalable and effective complement to multi-agent data,
making cooperative learning more practical and broadly applicable.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Developing efficient CUDA kernels is increasingly critical for AI
applications such as large-scale LLM training. However, manual kernel design is
both costly and time-consuming, motivating automatic approaches that leverage
LLMs for code generation. Existing methods for automatic kernel generation,
however, often produce low-efficiency kernels, incur high computational
overhead, and fail to generalize across settings. In this work, we propose
CudaForge, a training-free multi-agent workflow for CUDA kernel generation and
optimization. Our workflow is inspired by the iterative workflow of human
experts, which contains steps such as developing initial kernels, testing
correctness, analyzing hardware feedback, and iterative improvement. More
specifically, CudaForge employs two LLM agents: a Coder and a Judge, that
iteratively generate, correct, and optimize CUDA kernels, while integrating
hardware feedback such as Nsight Compute (NCU) metrics. In extensive
evaluations, we show that CudaForge, by leveraging base models like OpenAI-o3,
achieves 97.6\% correctness of generated kernels and an average 1.68$\times$
speedup over PyTorch baselines, substantially surpassing state-of-the-art
models including OpenAI-o3 and Kevin on KernelBench. Beyond accuracy and speed,
CudaForge demonstrates strong generalization across GPUs (A100, RTX 6000, 4090,
3090) and base models (OpenAI-o3, GPT-5, gpt-oss-120B, Claude-Sonnet-4,
QwQ-32B), while maintaining high efficiency. In particular, generating an
optimized kernel takes about 26.5 minutes on one RTX6000 and incurs about \$
0.3 API cost, which is significantly cheaper than existing agentic work that
costs 6 H100 hours and \$ 5 API cost per kernel. Our results highlight that
multi-agent, training-free workflows can enable cost-effective, generalizable,
and high-performance CUDA kernel optimization. Code available at

Abstract: Multimodal deep learning has shown promise in depression detection by
integrating text, audio, and video signals. Recent work leverages sentiment
analysis to enhance emotional understanding, yet suffers from high
computational cost, domain mismatch, and static knowledge limitations. To
address these issues, we propose a novel Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
framework. Given a depression-related text, our method retrieves semantically
relevant emotional content from a sentiment dataset and uses a Large Language
Model (LLM) to generate an Emotion Prompt as an auxiliary modality. This prompt
enriches emotional representation and improves interpretability. Experiments on
the AVEC 2019 dataset show our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance
with CCC of 0.593 and MAE of 3.95, surpassing previous transfer learning and
multi-task learning baselines.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Classification is a machine learning method used in many practical
applications: text mining, handwritten character recognition, face recognition,
pattern classification, scene labeling, computer vision, natural langage
processing. A classifier prediction results and training set information are
often used to get a contingency table which is used to quantify the method
quality through an evaluation measure. Such measure, typically a numerical
value, allows to choose a suitable method among several. Many evaluation
measures available in the literature are less accurate for a dataset with
imbalanced classes. In this paper, the eigenvalues entropy is used as an
evaluation measure for a binary or a multi-class problem. For a binary problem,
relations are given between the eigenvalues and some commonly used measures,
the sensitivity, the specificity, the area under the operating receiver
characteristic curve and the Gini index. A by-product result of this paper is
an estimate of the confusion matrix to deal with the curse of the imbalanced
classes. Various data examples are used to show the better performance of the
proposed evaluation measure over the gold standard measures available in the
literature.

Abstract: Traditional methods for high-dimensional diffeomorphic mapping often struggle
with the curse of dimensionality. We propose a mesh-free learning framework
designed for $n$-dimensional mapping problems, seamlessly combining variational
principles with quasi-conformal theory. Our approach ensures accurate,
bijective mappings by regulating conformality distortion and volume distortion,
enabling robust control over deformation quality. The framework is inherently
compatible with gradient-based optimization and neural network architectures,
making it highly flexible and scalable to higher-dimensional settings.
Numerical experiments on both synthetic and real-world medical image data
validate the accuracy, robustness, and effectiveness of the proposed method in
complex registration scenarios.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly trained with classical
optimization techniques like AdamW to improve convergence and generalization.
However, the mechanisms by which quantum-inspired methods enhance classical
training remain underexplored. We introduce Superpositional Gradient Descent
(SGD), a novel optimizer linking gradient updates with quantum superposition by
injecting quantum circuit perturbations. We present a mathematical framework
and implement hybrid quantum-classical circuits in PyTorch and Qiskit. On
synthetic sequence classification and large-scale LLM fine-tuning, SGD
converges faster and yields lower final loss than AdamW. Despite promising
results, scalability and hardware constraints limit adoption. Overall, this
work provides new insights into the intersection of quantum computing and deep
learning, suggesting practical pathways for leveraging quantum principles to
control and enhance model behavior.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We introduce Neural Green's Function, a neural solution operator for linear
partial differential equations (PDEs) whose differential operators admit
eigendecompositions. Inspired by Green's functions, the solution operators of
linear PDEs that depend exclusively on the domain geometry, we design Neural
Green's Function to imitate their behavior, achieving superior generalization
across diverse irregular geometries and source and boundary functions.
Specifically, Neural Green's Function extracts per-point features from a
volumetric point cloud representing the problem domain and uses them to predict
a decomposition of the solution operator, which is subsequently applied to
evaluate solutions via numerical integration. Unlike recent learning-based
solution operators, which often struggle to generalize to unseen source or
boundary functions, our framework is, by design, agnostic to the specific
functions used during training, enabling robust and efficient generalization.
In the steady-state thermal analysis of mechanical part geometries from the MCB
dataset, Neural Green's Function outperforms state-of-the-art neural operators,
achieving an average error reduction of 13.9\% across five shape categories,
while being up to 350 times faster than a numerical solver that requires
computationally expensive meshing.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Solving large-scale Generalized Eigenvalue Problems (GEPs) is a fundamental
yet computationally prohibitive task in science and engineering. As a promising
direction, contour integral (CI) methods, such as the CIRR algorithm, offer an
efficient and parallelizable framework. However, their performance is
critically dependent on the selection of integration contours -- improper
selection without reliable prior knowledge of eigenvalue distribution can incur
significant computational overhead and compromise numerical accuracy. To
address this challenge, we propose DeepContour, a novel hybrid framework that
integrates a deep learning-based spectral predictor with Kernel Density
Estimation for principled contour design. Specifically, DeepContour first
employs a Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) to rapidly predict the spectral
distribution of a given GEP. Subsequently, Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) is
applied to the predicted spectrum to automatically and systematically determine
proper integration contours. Finally, these optimized contours guide the CI
solver to efficiently find the desired eigenvalues. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method on diverse challenging scientific problems. In our
main experiments, DeepContour accelerates GEP solving across multiple datasets,
achieving up to a 5.63$\times$ speedup. By combining the predictive power of
deep learning with the numerical rigor of classical solvers, this work pioneers
an efficient and robust paradigm for tackling difficult generalized eigenvalue
involving matrices of high dimension.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Human trajectory data is crucial in urban planning, traffic engineering, and
public health. However, directly using real-world trajectory data often faces
challenges such as privacy concerns, data acquisition costs, and data quality.
A practical solution to these challenges is trajectory generation, a method
developed to simulate human mobility behaviors. Existing trajectory generation
methods mainly focus on capturing individual movement patterns but often
overlook the influence of population distribution on trajectory generation. In
reality, dynamic population distribution reflects changes in population density
across different regions, significantly impacting individual mobility behavior.
Thus, we propose a novel trajectory generation framework based on a diffusion
model, which integrates the dynamic population distribution constraints to
guide high-fidelity generation outcomes. Specifically, we construct a spatial
graph to enhance the spatial correlation of trajectories. Then, we design a
dynamic population distribution aware denoising network to capture the
spatiotemporal dependencies of human mobility behavior as well as the impact of
population distribution in the denoising process. Extensive experiments show
that the trajectories generated by our model can resemble real-world
trajectories in terms of some critical statistical metrics, outperforming
state-of-the-art algorithms by over 54%.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Image generation models are usually personalized in practical uses in order
to better meet the individual users' heterogeneous needs, but most personalized
models lack explainability about how they are being personalized. Such
explainability can be provided via visual features in generated images, but is
difficult for human users to understand. Explainability in natural language is
a better choice, but the existing approaches to explainability in natural
language are limited to be coarse-grained. They are unable to precisely
identify the multiple aspects of personalization, as well as the varying levels
of personalization in each aspect. To address such limitation, in this paper we
present a new technique, namely \textbf{FineXL}, towards \textbf{Fine}-grained
e\textbf{X}plainability in natural \textbf{L}anguage for personalized image
generation models. FineXL can provide natural language descriptions about each
distinct aspect of personalization, along with quantitative scores indicating
the level of each aspect of personalization. Experiment results show that
FineXL can improve the accuracy of explainability by 56\%, when different
personalization scenarios are applied to multiple types of image generation
models.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Training tool-augmented LLMs has emerged as a promising approach to enhancing
language models' capabilities for complex tasks. The current supervised
fine-tuning paradigm relies on constructing extensive domain-specific datasets
to train models. However, this approach often struggles to generalize
effectively to unfamiliar or intricate tool-use scenarios. Recently,
reinforcement learning (RL) paradigm can endow LLMs with superior reasoning and
generalization abilities. In this work, we address a key question: Can the pure
RL be used to effectively elicit a model's intrinsic reasoning capabilities and
enhance the tool-agnostic generalization? We propose a dynamic
generalization-guided reward design for rule-based RL, which progressively
shifts rewards from exploratory to exploitative tool-use patterns. Based on
this design, we introduce the Tool-Zero series models. These models are trained
to enable LLMs to autonomously utilize general tools by directly scaling up RL
from Zero models (i.e., base models without post-training). Experimental
results demonstrate that our models achieve over 7% performance improvement
compared to both SFT and RL-with-SFT models under the same experimental
settings. These gains are consistently replicated across cross-dataset and
intra-dataset evaluations, validating the effectiveness and robustness of our
methods.

Abstract: The determination of sample size in qualitative research has traditionally
relied on the subjective and often ambiguous principle of data saturation,
which can lead to inconsistencies and threaten methodological rigor. This study
introduces a new, systematic model based on machine learning (ML) to make this
process more objective. Utilizing a dataset derived from five fundamental
qualitative research approaches - namely, Case Study, Grounded Theory,
Phenomenology, Narrative Research, and Ethnographic Research - we developed an
ensemble learning model. Ten critical parameters, including research scope,
information power, and researcher competence, were evaluated using an ordinal
scale and used as input features. After thorough preprocessing and outlier
removal, multiple ML algorithms were trained and compared. The K-Nearest
Neighbors (KNN), Gradient Boosting (GB), Random Forest (RF), XGBoost, and
Decision Tree (DT) algorithms showed the highest explanatory power (Test R2 ~
0.85), effectively modeling the complex, non-linear relationships involved in
qualitative sampling decisions. Feature importance analysis confirmed the vital
roles of research design type and information power, providing quantitative
validation of key theoretical assumptions in qualitative methodology. The study
concludes by proposing a conceptual framework for a web-based computational
application designed to serve as a decision support system for qualitative
researchers, journal reviewers, and thesis advisors. This model represents a
significant step toward standardizing sample size justification, enhancing
transparency, and strengthening the epistemological foundation of qualitative
inquiry through evidence-based, systematic decision-making.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) trained for step-by-step reasoning often become
excessively verbose, raising inference cost. Standard Reinforcement Learning
with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) pipelines filter out ``easy'' problems for
training efficiency, leaving the model to train primarily on harder problems
that require longer reasoning chains. This skews the output length distribution
upward, resulting in a \textbf{model that conflates ``thinking longer'' with
``thinking better''}. In this work, we show that retaining and modestly
up-weighting moderately easy problems acts as an implicit length regularizer.
Exposing the model to solvable short-chain tasks constrains its output
distribution and prevents runaway verbosity. The result is
\textbf{\emph{emergent brevity for free}}: the model learns to solve harder
problems without inflating the output length, \textbf{ despite the absence of
any explicit length penalization}. RLVR experiments using this approach on
\textit{Qwen3-4B-Thinking-2507} (with a 16k token limit) achieve baseline
pass@1 AIME25 accuracy while generating solutions that are, on average, nearly
twice as short. The code is available at

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Grokking is a puzzling phenomenon in neural networks where full
generalization occurs only after a substantial delay following the complete
memorization of the training data. Previous research has linked this delayed
generalization to representation learning driven by weight decay, but the
precise underlying dynamics remain elusive. In this paper, we argue that
post-memorization learning can be understood through the lens of constrained
optimization: gradient descent effectively minimizes the weight norm on the
zero-loss manifold. We formally prove this in the limit of infinitesimally
small learning rates and weight decay coefficients. To further dissect this
regime, we introduce an approximation that decouples the learning dynamics of a
subset of parameters from the rest of the network. Applying this framework, we
derive a closed-form expression for the post-memorization dynamics of the first
layer in a two-layer network. Experiments confirm that simulating the training
process using our predicted gradients reproduces both the delayed
generalization and representation learning characteristic of grokking.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a severe disease with a typical
survival of 3-5 years after symptom onset. Current treatments offer only
limited life extension, and the variability in patient responses highlights the
need for personalized care. However, research is hindered by small,
heterogeneous cohorts, sparse longitudinal data, and the lack of a clear
definition for clinically meaningful patient clusters. Existing clustering
methods remain limited in both scope and number. To address this, we propose a
clustering approach that groups sequences using a disease progression
declarative score. Our approach integrates medical expertise through multiple
descriptive variables, investigating several distance measures combining such
variables, both by reusing off-the-shelf distances and employing a
weak-supervised learning method. We pair these distances with clustering
methods and benchmark them against state-of-the-art techniques. The evaluation
of our approach on a dataset of 353 ALS patients from the University Hospital
of Tours, shows that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in
survival analysis while achieving comparable silhouette scores. In addition,
the learned distances enhance the relevance and interpretability of results for

Abstract: Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are promising adsorbents for gas
adsorption and separation, while identifying the optimal structures among their
vast design space requires efficient high-throughput screening. Conventional
machine-learning predictors rely heavily on specific gas-related features.
However, these features are time-consuming and limit scalability, leading to
inefficiency and labor-intensive processes. Herein, a universal COFs adsorption
prediction framework (COFAP) is proposed, which can extract multi-modal
structural and chemical features through deep learning, and fuse these
complementary features via cross-modal attention mechanism. Without Henry
coefficients or adsorption heat, COFAP sets a new SOTA by outperforming
previous approaches on hypoCOFs dataset. Based on COFAP, we also found that
high-performing COFs for separation concentrate within a narrow range of pore
size and surface area. A weight-adjustable prioritization scheme is also
developed to enable flexible, application-specific ranking of candidate COFs
for researchers. Superior efficiency and accuracy render COFAP directly
deployable in crystalline porous materials.

Abstract: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains a critical global health concern,
demanding reliable and interpretable predictive models for early risk
assessment. This study presents a large-scale analysis using the Heart Disease
Health Indicators Dataset, developing a strategically weighted ensemble model
that combines tree-based methods (LightGBM, XGBoost) with a Convolutional
Neural Network (CNN) to predict CVD risk. The model was trained on a
preprocessed dataset of 229,781 patients where the inherent class imbalance was
managed through strategic weighting and feature engineering enhanced the
original 22 features to 25. The final ensemble achieves a statistically
significant improvement over the best individual model, with a Test AUC of
0.8371 (p=0.003) and is particularly suited for screening with a high recall of
80.0%. To provide transparency and clinical interpretability, surrogate
decision trees and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) are used. The proposed
model delivers a combination of robust predictive performance and clinical
transparency by blending diverse learning architectures and incorporating
explainability through SHAP and surrogate decision trees, making it a strong
candidate for real-world deployment in public health screening.

Abstract: Standard Recurrent Neural Networks, including LSTMs, struggle to model
long-range dependencies, particularly in sequences containing noisy or
misleading information. We propose a new architectural principle,
Output-Conditioned Gating, which enables a model to perform self-reflection by
modulating its internal memory gates based on its own past inferences. This
creates a stabilizing feedback loop that enhances memory retention. Our final
model, the EchoLSTM, integrates this principle with an attention mechanism. We
evaluate the EchoLSTM on a series of challenging benchmarks. On a
custom-designed Distractor Signal Task, the EchoLSTM achieves 69.0% accuracy,
decisively outperforming a standard LSTM baseline by 33 percentage points.
Furthermore, on the standard ListOps benchmark, the EchoLSTM achieves
performance competitive with a modern Transformer model, 69.8% vs. 71.8%, while
being over 5 times more parameter-efficient. A final Trigger Sensitivity Test
provides qualitative evidence that our model's self-reflective mechanism leads
to a fundamentally more robust memory system.

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) and local field potentials (LFP) are two widely
used techniques to record electrical activity from the brain. These signals are
used in both the clinical and research domains for multiple applications.
However, most brain data recordings suffer from a myriad of artifacts and noise
sources other than the brain itself. Thus, a major requirement for their use is
proper and, given current volumes of data, a fully automatized conditioning. As
a means to this end, here we introduce an unsupervised, multipurpose EEG/LFP
preprocessing method, the NeuroClean pipeline. In addition to its completeness
and reliability, NeuroClean is an unsupervised series of algorithms intended to
mitigate reproducibility issues and biases caused by human intervention. The
pipeline is designed as a five-step process, including the common bandpass and
line noise filtering, and bad channel rejection. However, it incorporates an
efficient independent component analysis with an automatic component rejection
based on a clustering algorithm. This machine learning classifier is used to
ensure that task-relevant information is preserved after each step of the
cleaning process. We used several data sets to validate the pipeline.
NeuroClean removed several common types of artifacts from the signal. Moreover,
in the context of motor tasks of varying complexity, it yielded more than 97%
accuracy (vs. a chance-level of 33.3%) in an optimized Multinomial Logistic
Regression model after cleaning the data, compared to the raw data, which
performed at 74% accuracy. These results show that NeuroClean is a promising
pipeline and workflow that can be applied to future work and studies to achieve
better generalization and performance on machine learning pipelines.

Abstract: We present the bulk-boundary decomposition as a new framework for
understanding the training dynamics of deep neural networks. Starting from the
stochastic gradient descent formulation, we show that the Lagrangian can be
reorganized into a data-independent bulk term and a data-dependent boundary
term. The bulk captures the intrinsic dynamics set by network architecture and
activation functions, while the boundary reflects stochastic interactions from
training samples at the input and output layers. This decomposition exposes the
local and homogeneous structure underlying deep networks. As a natural
extension, we develop a field-theoretic formulation of neural dynamics based on
this decomposition.

Abstract: Speculative decoding accelerates LLMs by using a lightweight draft model to
generate tokens autoregressively before verifying them in parallel with a
larger target model. However, determining the optimal number of tokens to draft
remains a key challenge limiting the approach's effectiveness. Dynamic
speculative decoding aims to intelligently decide how many tokens to draft to
achieve maximum speedups. Existing methods often rely on hand-tuned, sensitive
thresholds (e.g., token entropy), which are costly to set and generalize poorly
across models and domains. We propose TapOut, an online, training-free,
plug-and-play algorithm for dynamic speculation policy selection using
multi-armed bandits. Our approach employs a meta-algorithm that selects among
multiple parameter-free dynamic speculation strategies based on past reward and
exploration. We conduct extensive experiments across diverse model pairs and
datasets, showing that TapOut achieves competitive or superior speedups
compared to well-established dynamic speculation baselines without any
hyperparameter tuning.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Recent work has discovered that large language models can develop broadly
misaligned behaviors after being fine-tuned on narrowly harmful datasets, a
phenomenon known as emergent misalignment (EM). However, the fundamental
mechanisms enabling such harmful generalization across disparate domains remain
poorly understood. In this work, we adopt a geometric perspective to study EM
and demonstrate that it exhibits a fundamental cross-task linear structure in
how harmful behavior is encoded across different datasets. Specifically, we
find a strong convergence in EM parameters across tasks, with the fine-tuned
weight updates showing relatively high cosine similarities, as well as shared
lower-dimensional subspaces as measured by their principal angles and
projection overlaps. Furthermore, we also show functional equivalence via
linear mode connectivity, wherein interpolated models across narrow
misalignment tasks maintain coherent, broadly misaligned behavior. Our results
indicate that EM arises from different narrow tasks discovering the same set of
shared parameter directions, suggesting that harmful behaviors may be organized
into specific, predictable regions of the weight landscape. By revealing this
fundamental connection between parametric geometry and behavioral outcomes, we
hope our work catalyzes further research on parameter space interpretability
and weight-based interventions.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Rare events such as financial crashes, climate extremes, and biological
anomalies are notoriously difficult to model due to their scarcity and
heavy-tailed distributions. Classical deep generative models often struggle to
capture these rare occurrences, either collapsing low-probability modes or
producing poorly calibrated uncertainty estimates. In this work, we propose the
Quantum-Enhanced Generative Model (QEGM), a hybrid classical-quantum framework
that integrates deep latent-variable models with variational quantum circuits.
The framework introduces two key innovations: (1) a hybrid loss function that
jointly optimizes reconstruction fidelity and tail-aware likelihood, and (2)
quantum randomness-driven noise injection to enhance sample diversity and
mitigate mode collapse. Training proceeds via a hybrid loop where classical
parameters are updated through backpropagation while quantum parameters are
optimized using parameter-shift gradients. We evaluate QEGM on synthetic
Gaussian mixtures and real-world datasets spanning finance, climate, and
protein structure. Results demonstrate that QEGM reduces tail KL divergence by
up to 50 percent compared to state-of-the-art baselines (GAN, VAE, Diffusion),
while improving rare-event recall and coverage calibration. These findings
highlight the potential of QEGM as a principled approach for rare-event
prediction, offering robustness beyond what is achievable with purely classical
methods.

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting is one of the fundamental issues of continual
learning because neural networks forget the tasks learned previously when
trained on new tasks. The proposed framework is a new path-coordinated
framework of continual learning that unites the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK)
theory of principled plasticity bounds, statistical validation by Wilson
confidence intervals, and evaluation of path quality by the use of multiple
metrics. Experimental evaluation shows an average accuracy of 66.7% at the cost
of 23.4% catastrophic forgetting on Split-CIFAR10, a huge improvement over the
baseline and competitive performance achieved, which is very close to
state-of-the-art results. Further, it is found out that NTK condition numbers
are predictive indicators of learning capacity limits, showing the existence of
a critical threshold at condition number $>10^{11}$. It is interesting to note
that the proposed strategy shows a tendency of lowering forgetting as the
sequence of tasks progresses (27% to 18%), which is a system stabilization. The
framework validates 80% of discovered paths with a rigorous statistical
guarantee and maintains 90-97% retention on intermediate tasks. The core
capacity limits of the continual learning environment are determined in the
analysis, and actionable insights to enhance the adaptive regularization are
offered.

Abstract: Predicting interspecies interactions is a key challenge in microbial ecology,
as these interactions are critical to determining the structure and activity of
microbial communities. In this work, we used data on monoculture growth
capabilities, interactions with other species, and phylogeny to predict a
negative or positive effect of interactions. More precisely, we used one of the
largest available pairwise interaction datasets to train our models, comprising
over 7,500 interactions be- tween 20 species from two taxonomic groups
co-cultured under 40 distinct carbon conditions, with a primary focus on the
work of Nestor et al.[28 ]. In this work, we propose Graph Neural Networks
(GNNs) as a powerful classifier to predict the direction of the effect. We
construct edge-graphs of pairwise microbial interactions in order to leverage
shared information across individual co-culture experiments, and use GNNs to
predict modes of interaction. Our model can not only predict binary
interactions (positive/negative) but also classify more complex interaction
types such as mutualism, competition, and parasitism. Our initial results were
encouraging, achieving an F1-score of 80.44%. This significantly outperforms
comparable methods in the literature, including conventional Extreme Gradient
Boosting (XGBoost) models, which reported an F1-score of 72.76%.

Abstract: Bad charactors when submitting to arXiv: Attention is a fundamental building
block of large language models (LLMs), so there have been many efforts to
implement it efficiently. For example, FlashAttention leverages tiling and
kernel fusion to optimize attention. Recently, a number of variants of
attention have been introduced to enhance model quality or efficiency.
Supporting them efficiently remains difficult since they usually require
specialized kernels or hand-tuned implementations. FlexAttention recently
addressed part of this gap by using static programming templates to support
FlashAttention-like kernels for a subset of attention variants.
  In this paper, we introduce Flashlight, a compiler-native framework within
the PyTorch ecosystem that automatically generates fused, FlashAttention-style
kernels for arbitrary attention-based programs, without relying on static
templates or predefined kernel specializations. Flashlight leverages PyTorch's
compilation workflow to fuse and tile attention computations transparently,
enabling efficient execution for diverse attention patterns. Not only does it
support all variants expressible in the FlexAttention model but it also handles
more general, data-dependent attention formulations that are beyond the
capabilities of FlexAttention.
  Our results show that Flashlight produces kernels with competitive or
superior performance to FlexAttention, while offering the flexibility of native
PyTorch code, enabling developers to rapidly explore new attention models
without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: Fine-tuning LLMs for classification typically maps inputs directly to labels.
We ask whether attaching brief explanations to each label during fine-tuning
yields better models. We evaluate conversational response quality along three
axes: naturalness, comprehensiveness, and on-topic adherence, each rated on
5-point scales. Using ensemble-generated data from multiple LLMs, we fine-tune
a 7B-parameter model and test across six diverse conversational datasets.
Across 18 dataset, task settings, label-plus-explanation training outperforms
label-only baselines.
  A central and unexpected result concerns random tokens. We replace
human-written explanations with text that is syntactically incoherent yet
vocabulary-aligned with the originals (e.g., shuffled or bag-of-words
variants). Despite lacking semantics, these pseudo-explanations still improve
accuracy over label-only training and often narrow much of the gap to true
explanations. The effect persists across datasets and training seeds,
indicating that gains arise less from meaning than from structure: the extra
token budget encourages richer intermediate computation and acts as a
regularizer that reduces over-confident shortcuts.
  Internal analyses support this view: explanation-augmented models exhibit
higher activation entropy in intermediate layers alongside sharper predictive
mass at the output layer, consistent with increased deliberation before
decision. Overall, explanation-augmented fine-tuning, whether with genuine
rationales or carefully constructed random token sequences, improves accuracy
and reliability for LLM classification while clarifying how token-level
scaffolding shapes computation during inference.

Abstract: Objective gait analysis using wearable sensors and AI is critical for
managing neurological and orthopedic conditions. However, models are vulnerable
to hidden dataset biases, and task-specific sensor optimization remains a
challenge. We propose a multi-stream attention-based deep learning framework
that functions as both a sensor optimizer and an automated data auditor.
Applied to the Voisard et al. (2025) multi-cohort gait dataset on four clinical
tasks (PD, OA, CVA screening; PD vs CVA differential), the model's attention
mechanism quantitatively discovered a severe dataset confound. For OA and CVA
screening, tasks where bilateral assessment is clinically essential, the model
assigned more than 70 percent attention to the Right Foot while statistically
ignoring the Left Foot (less than 0.1 percent attention, 95 percent CI
[0.0-0.1]). This was not a clinical finding but a direct reflection of a severe
laterality bias (for example, 15 of 15 right-sided OA) in the public dataset.
The primary contribution of this work is methodological, demonstrating that an
interpretable framework can automatically audit dataset integrity. As a
secondary finding, the model proposes novel, data-driven sensor synergies (for
example, Head plus Foot for PD screening) as hypotheses for future optimized
protocols.

Abstract: Effectively leveraging prior knowledge of a system's physics is crucial for
applications of machine learning to scientific domains. Previous approaches
mostly focused on incorporating physical insights at the architectural level.
In this paper, we propose a framework to leverage physical information directly
into the loss function for prediction and generative modeling tasks on systems
like molecules and spins. We derive energy loss functions assuming that each
data sample is in thermal equilibrium with respect to an approximate energy
landscape. By using the reverse KL divergence with a Boltzmann distribution
around the data, we obtain the loss as an energy difference between the data
and the model predictions. This perspective also recasts traditional objectives
like MSE as energy-based, but with a physically meaningless energy. In
contrast, our formulation yields physically grounded loss functions with
gradients that better align with valid configurations, while being
architecture-agnostic and computationally efficient. The energy loss functions
also inherently respect physical symmetries. We demonstrate our approach on
molecular generation and spin ground-state prediction and report significant
improvements over baselines.

Abstract: Contrast-Consistent Search (CCS) is an unsupervised probing method able to
test whether large language models represent binary features, such as sentence
truth, in their internal activations. While CCS has shown promise, its two-term
objective has been only partially understood. In this work, we revisit CCS with
the aim of clarifying its mechanisms and extending its applicability. We argue
that what should be optimized for, is relative contrast consistency. Building
on this insight, we reformulate CCS as an eigenproblem, yielding closed-form
solutions with interpretable eigenvalues and natural extensions to multiple
variables. We evaluate these approaches across a range of datasets, finding
that they recover similar performance to CCS, while avoiding problems around
sensitivity to random initialization. Our results suggest that relativizing
contrast consistency not only improves our understanding of CCS but also opens
pathways for broader probing and mechanistic interpretability methods.

Abstract: The field of world modeling is fragmented, with researchers developing
bespoke architectures that rarely build upon each other. We propose a framework
that specifies the natural building blocks for structured world models based on
the fundamental stochastic processes that any world model must capture:
discrete processes (logic, symbols) and continuous processes (physics,
dynamics); the world model is then defined by the hierarchical composition of
these building blocks. We examine Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and switching
linear dynamical systems (sLDS) as natural building blocks for discrete and
continuous modeling--which become partially-observable Markov decision
processes (POMDPs) and controlled sLDS when augmented with actions. This
modular approach supports both passive modeling (generation, forecasting) and
active control (planning, decision-making) within the same architecture. We
avoid the combinatorial explosion of traditional structure learning by largely
fixing the causal architecture and searching over only four depth parameters.
We review practical expressiveness through multimodal generative modeling
(passive) and planning from pixels (active), with performance competitive to
neural approaches while maintaining interpretability. The core outstanding
challenge is scalable joint structure-parameter learning; current methods
finesse this by cleverly growing structure and parameters incrementally, but
are limited in their scalability. If solved, these natural building blocks
could provide foundational infrastructure for world modeling, analogous to how
standardized layers enabled progress in deep learning.

Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) is poised to play a pivotal role in the development and
operation of next-generation fusion devices. Fusion data shows non-stationary
behavior with distribution drifts, resulted by both experimental evolution and
machine wear-and-tear. ML models assume stationary distribution and fail to
maintain performance when encountered with such non-stationary data streams.
Online learning techniques have been leveraged in other domains, however it has
been largely unexplored for fusion applications. In this paper, we present an
application of online learning to continuously adapt to drifting data stream
for prediction of Toroidal Field (TF) coils deflection at the DIII-D fusion
facility. The results demonstrate that online learning is critical to maintain
ML model performance and reduces error by 80% compared to a static model.
Moreover, traditional online learning can suffer from short-term performance
degradation as ground truth is not available before making the predictions. As
such, we propose an uncertainty guided online ensemble method to further
improve the performance. The Deep Gaussian Process Approximation (DGPA)
technique is leveraged for calibrated uncertainty estimation and the
uncertainty values are then used to guide a meta-algorithm that produces
predictions based on an ensemble of learners trained on different horizon of
historical data. The DGPA also provides uncertainty estimation along with the
predictions for decision makers. The online ensemble and the proposed
uncertainty guided online ensemble reduces predictions error by about 6%, and
10% respectively over standard single model based online learning.

Abstract: Shapley data valuation provides a principled, axiomatic framework for
assigning importance to individual datapoints, and has gained traction in
dataset curation, pruning, and pricing. However, it is a combinatorial measure
that requires evaluating marginal utility across all subsets of the data,
making it computationally infeasible at scale. We propose a geometric
alternative based on statistical leverage scores, which quantify each
datapoint's structural influence in the representation space by measuring how
much it extends the span of the dataset and contributes to the effective
dimensionality of the training problem. We show that our scores satisfy the
dummy, efficiency, and symmetry axioms of Shapley valuation and that extending
them to \emph{ridge leverage scores} yields strictly positive marginal gains
that connect naturally to classical A- and D-optimal design criteria. We
further show that training on a leverage-sampled subset produces a model whose
parameters and predictive risk are within $O(\varepsilon)$ of the full-data
optimum, thereby providing a rigorous link between data valuation and
downstream decision quality. Finally, we conduct an active learning experiment
in which we empirically demonstrate that ridge-leverage sampling outperforms
standard baselines without requiring access gradients or backward passes.

Abstract: Within the context of representation learning for Earth observation,
geographic Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) embed low-dimensional
location inputs (longitude, latitude) into high-dimensional embeddings, through
models trained on geo-referenced satellite, image or text data. Despite the
common aim of geographic INRs to distill Earth's data into compact,
learning-friendly representations, we lack an understanding of how much
information is contained in these Earth representations, and where that
information is concentrated. The intrinsic dimension of a dataset measures the
number of degrees of freedom required to capture its local variability,
regardless of the ambient high-dimensional space in which it is embedded. This
work provides the first study of the intrinsic dimensionality of geographic
INRs. Analyzing INRs with ambient dimension between 256 and 512, we find that
their intrinsic dimensions fall roughly between 2 and 10 and are sensitive to
changing spatial resolution and input modalities during INR pre-training.
Furthermore, we show that the intrinsic dimension of a geographic INR
correlates with downstream task performance and can capture spatial artifacts,
facilitating model evaluation and diagnostics. More broadly, our work offers an
architecture-agnostic, label-free metric of information content that can enable
unsupervised evaluation, model selection, and pre-training design across INRs.

through the study of noisy matrix sensing. In traditional regression tasks,
mean squared error (MSE) loss is a common choice, but it can be unreliable for
non-Gaussian or heavy-tailed noise. To address this issue, we adopt a robust
loss based on nonparametric regression, which uses a kernel-based estimate of
the residual density and maximizes the estimated log-likelihood. This robust
formulation coincides with the MSE loss under Gaussian errors but remains
stable under more general settings. We further examine how this robust loss
reshapes the optimization landscape by analyzing the upper-bound of restricted
isometry property (RIP) constants for spurious local minima to disappear.
Through theoretical and empirical analysis, we show that this new loss excels
at handling large noise and remains robust across diverse noise distributions.
This work offers initial insights into enhancing the robustness of machine
learning tasks through simply changing the loss, guided by an intuitive and
broadly applicable analytical framework.

Abstract: Variance-dependent regret bounds have received increasing attention in recent
studies on contextual bandits. However, most of these studies are focused on
upper confidence bound (UCB)-based bandit algorithms, while sampling based
bandit algorithms such as Thompson sampling are still understudied. The only
exception is the LinVDTS algorithm (Xu et al., 2023), which is limited to
linear reward function and its regret bound is not optimal with respect to the
model dimension. In this paper, we present FGTSVA, a variance-aware Thompson
Sampling algorithm for contextual bandits with general reward function with
optimal regret bound. At the core of our analysis is an extension of the
decoupling coefficient, a technique commonly used in the analysis of Feel-good
Thompson sampling (FGTS) that reflects the complexity of the model space. With
the new decoupling coefficient denoted by $\mathrm{dc}$, FGTS-VA achieves the
regret of
$\tilde{O}(\sqrt{\mathrm{dc}\cdot\log|\mathcal{F}|\sum_{t=1}^T\sigma_t^2}+\mathrm{dc})$,
where $|\mathcal{F}|$ is the size of the model space, $T$ is the total number
of rounds, and $\sigma_t^2$ is the subgaussian norm of the noise (e.g.,
variance when the noise is Gaussian) at round $t$. In the setting of contextual
linear bandits, the regret bound of FGTSVA matches that of UCB-based algorithms
using weighted linear regression (Zhou and Gu, 2022).

Abstract: Early identification of abnormal physiological patterns is essential for the
timely detection of cardiac disease. This work introduces a hybrid
quantum-classical convolutional neural network (QCNN) designed to classify S3
and murmur abnormalities in heart sound signals. The approach transforms
one-dimensional phonocardiogram (PCG) signals into compact two-dimensional
images through a combination of wavelet feature extraction and adaptive
threshold compression methods. We compress the cardiac-sound patterns into an
8-pixel image so that only 8 qubits are needed for the quantum stage.
Preliminary results on the HLS-CMDS dataset demonstrate 93.33% classification
accuracy on the test set and 97.14% on the train set, suggesting that quantum
models can efficiently capture temporal-spectral correlations in biomedical
signals. To our knowledge, this is the first application of a QCNN algorithm
for bioacoustic signal processing. The proposed method represents an early step
toward quantum-enhanced diagnostic systems for resource-constrained healthcare
environments.

Abstract: Drug synergy prediction is a critical task in the development of effective
combination therapies for complex diseases, including cancer. Although existing
methods have shown promising results, they often operate as black-box
predictors that rely predominantly on statistical correlations between drug
characteristics and results. To address this limitation, we propose CausalDDS,
a novel framework that disentangles drug molecules into causal and spurious
substructures, utilizing the causal substructure representations for predicting
drug synergy. By focusing on causal sub-structures, CausalDDS effectively
mitigates the impact of redundant features introduced by spurious
substructures, enhancing the accuracy and interpretability of the model. In
addition, CausalDDS employs a conditional intervention mechanism, where
interventions are conditioned on paired molecular structures, and introduces a
novel optimization objective guided by the principles of sufficiency and
independence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms
baseline models, particularly in cold start and out-of-distribution settings.
Besides, CausalDDS effectively identifies key substructures underlying drug
synergy, providing clear insights into how drug combinations work at the
molecular level. These results underscore the potential of CausalDDS as a
practical tool for predicting drug synergy and facilitating drug discovery.

Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) models are extensively used in various applications due
to their significant advantages over traditional learning methods. However, the
developed ML models often underperform when deployed in the real world due to
the well-known distribution shift problem. This problem can lead to a
catastrophic outcomes when these decision-making systems have to operate in
high-risk applications. Many researchers have previously studied this problem
in ML, known as distribution shift problem, using statistical techniques (such
as Kullback-Leibler, Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test, Wasserstein distance, etc.) to
quantify the distribution shift. In this letter, we show that using
Characteristic Function (CF) as a frequency domain approach is a powerful
alternative for measuring the distribution shift in high-dimensional space and
for domain adaptation.

Abstract: Time series data is one of the most popular data modalities in critical
domains such as industry and medicine. The demand for algorithms that not only
exhibit high accuracy but also offer interpretability is crucial in such
fields, as decisions made there bear significant consequences. In this paper,
we present ProtoTSNet, a novel approach to interpretable classification of
multivariate time series data, through substantial enhancements to the
ProtoPNet architecture. Our method is tailored to overcome the unique
challenges of time series analysis, including capturing dynamic patterns and
handling varying feature significance. Central to our innovation is a modified
convolutional encoder utilizing group convolutions, pre-trainable as part of an
autoencoder and designed to preserve and quantify feature importance. We
evaluated our model on 30 multivariate time series datasets from the UEA
archive, comparing our approach with existing explainable methods as well as
non-explainable baselines. Through comprehensive evaluation and ablation
studies, we demonstrate that our approach achieves the best performance among
ante-hoc explainable methods while maintaining competitive performance with
non-explainable and post-hoc explainable approaches, providing interpretable
results accessible to domain experts.

Abstract: Accurate air quality forecasts are vital for public health alerts, exposure
assessment, and emissions control. In practice, observational data are often
missing in varying proportions and patterns due to collection and transmission
issues. These incomplete spatiotemporal records impede reliable inference and
risk assessment and can lead to overconfident extrapolation. To address these
challenges, we propose an end to end framework, the channel gated learning unit
based spatiotemporal bayesian neural field (CGLUBNF). It uses Fourier features
with a graph attention encoder to capture multiscale spatial dependencies and
seasonal temporal dynamics. A channel gated learning unit, equipped with
learnable activations and gated residual connections, adaptively filters and
amplifies informative features. Bayesian inference jointly optimizes predictive
distributions and parameter uncertainty, producing point estimates and
calibrated prediction intervals. We conduct a systematic evaluation on two real
world datasets, covering four typical missing data patterns and comparing
against five state of the art baselines. CGLUBNF achieves superior prediction
accuracy and sharper confidence intervals. In addition, we further validate
robustness across multiple prediction horizons and analysis the contribution of
extraneous variables. This research lays a foundation for reliable deep
learning based spatio-temporal forecasting with incomplete observations in
emerging sensing paradigms, such as real world vehicle borne mobile monitoring.

Abstract: Multimodal spatiotemporal learning on real-world experimental data is
constrained by two challenges: within-modality measurements are sparse,
irregular, and noisy (QA/QC artifacts) but cross-modally correlated; the set of
available modalities varies across space and time, shrinking the usable record
unless models can adapt to arbitrary subsets at train and test time. We propose
OmniField, a continuity-aware framework that learns a continuous neural field
conditioned on available modalities and iteratively fuses cross-modal context.
A multimodal crosstalk block architecture paired with iterative cross-modal
refinement aligns signals prior to the decoder, enabling unified
reconstruction, interpolation, forecasting, and cross-modal prediction without
gridding or surrogate preprocessing. Extensive evaluations show that OmniField
consistently outperforms eight strong multimodal spatiotemporal baselines.
Under heavy simulated sensor noise, performance remains close to clean-input
levels, highlighting robustness to corrupted measurements.

Abstract: Agents that understand objects and their interactions can learn policies that
are more robust and transferable. However, most object-centric RL methods
factor state by individual objects while leaving interactions implicit. We
introduce the Factored Interactive Object-Centric World Model (FIOC-WM), a
unified framework that learns structured representations of both objects and
their interactions within a world model. FIOC-WM captures environment dynamics
with disentangled and modular representations of object interactions, improving
sample efficiency and generalization for policy learning. Concretely, FIOC-WM
first learns object-centric latents and an interaction structure directly from
pixels, leveraging pre-trained vision encoders. The learned world model then
decomposes tasks into composable interaction primitives, and a hierarchical
policy is trained on top: a high level selects the type and order of
interactions, while a low level executes them. On simulated robotic and
embodied-AI benchmarks, FIOC-WM improves policy-learning sample efficiency and
generalization over world-model baselines, indicating that explicit, modular
interaction learning is crucial for robust control.

Abstract: An increasing number of LLMs employ Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures
where the feed-forward layer is replaced by a pool of experts and each token
only activates a small subset of them. During autoregressive generation, these
models often enter a memory-bound regime even for moderate batch sizes because
the average expert load grows more slowly than in an equivalent dense
feedforward layer. Consequently, MoE latency is governed by the number of
activated experts. We introduce a framework for dynamically re-routing
token-to-expert mapping to lower this number (and thus, the decode latency)
while preserving a comparable quality. Our best results use a batch-aware
routing that works by having tokens piggyback experts that have already been
loaded into memory due to being crucial to other tokens within the same batch.
Empirically, we evaluate our method on the Qwen3-30B and Qwen3-235B models with
a batch size of $16$. Without any statistically significant loss in accuracy,
our approach achieves latency reductions of $39\%$ and $15\%$ in the MoE layer
decode latency, respectively.

Abstract: Initialization of neural network parameters, such as weights and biases, has
a crucial impact on learning performance; if chosen well, we can even avoid the
need for additional training with backpropagation. For example, algorithms
based on the ridgelet transform or the SWIM (sampling where it matters) concept
have been proposed for initialization. On the other hand, it is well-known that
neural networks tend to learn coarse information in the earlier layers. The
feature is called spectral bias. In this work, we investigate the effects of
utilizing information on the spectral bias in the initialization of neural
networks. Hence, we propose a framework that adjusts the scale factors in the
SWIM algorithm to capture low-frequency components in the early-stage hidden
layers and to represent high-frequency components in the late-stage hidden
layers. Numerical experiments on a one-dimensional regression task and the
MNIST classification task demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the
conventional initialization algorithms. This work clarifies the importance of
intrinsic spectral properties in learning neural networks, and the finding
yields an effective parameter initialization strategy that enhances their
training performance.

Abstract: Smoothness is known to be crucial for acceleration in offline optimization,
and for gradient-variation regret minimization in online learning.
Interestingly, these two problems are actually closely connected -- accelerated
optimization can be understood through the lens of gradient-variation online
learning. In this paper, we investigate online learning with H\"older smooth
functions, a general class encompassing both smooth and non-smooth (Lipschitz)
functions, and explore its implications for offline optimization. For
(strongly) convex online functions, we design the corresponding
gradient-variation online learning algorithm whose regret smoothly interpolates
between the optimal guarantees in smooth and non-smooth regimes. Notably, our
algorithms do not require prior knowledge of the H\"older smoothness parameter,
exhibiting strong adaptivity over existing methods. Through online-to-batch
conversion, this gradient-variation online adaptivity yields an optimal
universal method for stochastic convex optimization under H\"older smoothness.
However, achieving universality in offline strongly convex optimization is more
challenging. We address this by integrating online adaptivity with a
detection-based guess-and-check procedure, which, for the first time, yields a
universal offline method that achieves accelerated convergence in the smooth
regime while maintaining near-optimal convergence in the non-smooth one.

Abstract: Data assimilation (DA) has increasingly emerged as a critical tool for state
estimation
  across a wide range of applications. It is signiffcantly challenging when the
governing equations of the underlying dynamics are unknown. To this end,
various machine learning approaches have been employed to construct a surrogate
state transition
  model in a supervised learning framework, which relies on pre-computed
training
  datasets. However, it is often infeasible to obtain noise-free ground-truth
state sequences in practice. To address this challenge, we propose a novel
method that integrates reinforcement learning with ensemble-based Bayesian
ffltering methods, enabling
  the learning of surrogate state transition model for unknown dynamics
directly from noisy observations, without using true state trajectories.
Speciffcally, we treat the process for computing maximum likelihood estimation
of surrogate model parameters
  as a sequential decision-making problem, which can be formulated as a
discretetime
  Markov decision process (MDP). Under this formulation, learning the surrogate
transition model is equivalent to ffnding an optimal policy of the MDP, which
can be effectively addressed using reinforcement learning techniques. Once the
model is trained offfine, state estimation can be performed in the online stage
using ffltering methods based on the learned dynamics. The proposed framework
accommodates a wide range of observation scenarios, including nonlinear and
partially observed measurement
  models. A few numerical examples demonstrate that the proposed method
achieves superior accuracy and robustness in high-dimensional settings.

Abstract: The rapid growth of industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) systems has created
new challenges for anomaly detection in high-dimensional, multivariate
time-series, where privacy, scalability, and communication efficiency are
critical. Classical federated learning approaches mitigate privacy concerns by
enabling decentralized training, but they often struggle with highly non-linear
decision boundaries and imbalanced anomaly distributions. To address this gap,
we propose a Federated Quantum Kernel Learning (FQKL) framework that integrates
quantum feature maps with federated aggregation to enable distributed,
privacy-preserving anomaly detection across heterogeneous IoT networks. In our
design, quantum edge nodes locally compute compressed kernel statistics using
parameterized quantum circuits and share only these summaries with a central
server, which constructs a global Gram matrix and trains a decision function
(e.g., Fed-QSVM). Experimental results on synthetic IIoT benchmarks demonstrate
that FQKL achieves superior generalization in capturing complex temporal
correlations compared to classical federated baselines, while significantly
reducing communication overhead. This work highlights the promise of quantum
kernels in federated settings, advancing the path toward scalable, robust, and
quantum-enhanced intelligence for next-generation IoT infrastructures.

Abstract: Training large Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models remains computationally
prohibitive due to their extreme compute and memory demands. Although
low-precision training promises to accelerate computation and reduce memory
footprint, existing implementations still rely on BF16-dominated dataflows with
frequent quantize-dequantize (Q/DQ) conversions. These redundant casts erode
much of FP8's theoretical efficiency. However, naively removing these casts by
keeping dataflows entirely in FP8 introduces double quantization error: tensors
quantized along different dimensions accumulate inconsistent scaling factors,
degrading numerical stability.
  We propose FP8-Flow-MoE, an FP8 training recipe featuring a
quantization-consistent FP8-centric dataflow with a scaling-aware transpose and
fused FP8 operators that streamline computation and eliminate explicit cast
operations from 12 to 2. Evaluations on a 671B-parameter MoE model demonstrate
up to 21\% higher throughput and 16.5 GB lower memory usage per GPU compared to
BF16 and na\"ive FP8 baselines, while maintaining stable convergence. We
provide a plug-and-play FP8 recipe compatible with TransformerEngine and
Megatron-LM, which will be open-sourced soon.

Abstract: We revisit test-time scaling for language model reasoning and ask a
fundamental question: at equal token budget and compute, is it better to run
multiple independent chains in parallel, or to run fewer chains that
iteratively refine through sequential steps? Through comprehensive evaluation
across 5 state-of-the-art open source models and 3 challenging reasoning
benchmarks, we find that sequential scaling where chains explicitly build upon
previous attempts consistently outperforms the dominant parallel
self-consistency paradigm in 95.6% of configurations with gains in accuracy
upto 46.7%. Further, we introduce inverse-entropy weighted voting, a novel
training-free method to further boost the accuracy of sequential scaling. By
weighing answers in proportion to the inverse entropy of their reasoning
chains, we increase our success rate over parallel majority and establish it as
the optimal test-time scaling strategy. Our findings fundamentally challenge
the parallel reasoning orthodoxy that has dominated test-time scaling since
Wang et al.'s self-consistency decoding (Wang et al., 2022), positioning
sequential refinement as the robust default for modern LLM reasoning and
necessitating a paradigm shift in how we approach inference-time optimization.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Head-and-neck cancer (HNC) planning is difficult because multiple critical
organs-at-risk (OARs) are close to complex targets. Intensity-modulated
carbon-ion therapy (IMCT) offers superior dose conformity and OAR sparing but
remains slow due to relative biological effectiveness (RBE) modeling, leading
to laborious, experience-based, and often suboptimal tuning of many
treatment-planning parameters (TPPs). Recent deep learning (DL) methods are
limited by data bias and plan feasibility, while reinforcement learning (RL)
struggles to efficiently explore the exponentially large TPP search space. We
propose a scalable multi-agent RL (MARL) framework for parallel tuning of 45
TPPs in IMCT. It uses a centralized-training decentralized-execution (CTDE)
QMIX backbone with Double DQN, Dueling DQN, and recurrent encoding (DRQN) for
stable learning in a high-dimensional, non-stationary environment. To enhance
efficiency, we (1) use compact historical DVH vectors as state inputs, (2)
apply a linear action-to-value transform mapping small discrete actions to
uniform parameter adjustments, and (3) design an absolute, clinically informed
piecewise reward aligned with plan scores. A synchronous multi-process worker
system interfaces with the PHOENIX TPS for parallel optimization and
accelerated data collection. On a head-and-neck dataset (10 training, 10
testing), the method tuned 45 parameters simultaneously and produced plans
comparable to or better than expert manual ones (relative plan score: RL
$85.93\pm7.85%$ vs Manual $85.02\pm6.92%$), with significant (p-value $<$ 0.05)
improvements for five OARs. The framework efficiently explores high-dimensional
TPP spaces and generates clinically competitive IMCT plans through direct TPS
interaction, notably improving OAR sparing.

Abstract: Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) is a fundamental and powerful
framework for modeling complex optimization problems across diverse domains.
Recently, learning-based methods have shown great promise in accelerating MILP
solvers by predicting high-quality solutions. However, most existing approaches
are developed and evaluated in single-domain settings, limiting their ability
to generalize to unseen problem distributions. This limitation poses a major
obstacle to building scalable and general-purpose learning-based solvers. To
address this challenge, we introduce RoME, a domain-Robust Mixture-of-Experts
framework for predicting MILP solutions across domains. RoME dynamically routes
problem instances to specialized experts based on learned task embeddings. The
model is trained using a two-level distributionally robust optimization
strategy: inter-domain to mitigate global shifts across domains, and
intra-domain to enhance local robustness by introducing perturbations on task
embeddings. We reveal that cross-domain training not only enhances the model's
generalization capability to unseen domains but also improves performance
within each individual domain by encouraging the model to capture more general
intrinsic combinatorial patterns. Specifically, a single RoME model trained on
three domains achieves an average improvement of 67.7% then evaluated on five
diverse domains. We further test the pretrained model on MIPLIB in a zero-shot
setting, demonstrating its ability to deliver measurable performance gains on
challenging real-world instances where existing learning-based approaches often
struggle to generalize.

Abstract: Predicting crimes in urban environments is crucial for public safety, yet
existing prediction methods often struggle to align the knowledge across
diverse cities that vary dramatically in data availability of specific crime
types. We propose HYpernetwork-enhanced Spatial Temporal Learning (HYSTL), a
framework that can effectively train a unified, stronger crime predictor
without assuming identical crime types in different cities' records. In HYSTL,
instead of parameterising a dedicated predictor per crime type, a hypernetwork
is designed to dynamically generate parameters for the prediction function
conditioned on the crime type of interest. To bridge the semantic gap between
different crime types, a structured crime knowledge graph is built, where the
learned representations of crimes are used as the input to the hypernetwork to
facilitate parameter generation. As such, when making predictions for each
crime type, the predictor is additionally guided by its intricate association
with other relevant crime types. Extensive experiments are performed on two
cities with non-overlapping crime types, and the results demonstrate HYSTL
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

Abstract: Preconditioning is a key component of MCMC algorithms that improves sampling
efficiency by facilitating exploration of geometrically complex target
distributions through an invertible map. While linear preconditioners are often
sufficient for moderately complex target distributions, recent work has
explored nonlinear preconditioning with invertible neural networks as
components of normalizing flows (NFs). However, empirical and theoretical
studies show that overparameterized NF preconditioners can degrade sampling
efficiency and fit quality. Moreover, existing NF-based approaches do not adapt
their architectures to the target distribution. Related work outside of MCMC
similarly finds that suitably parameterized NFs can achieve comparable or
superior performance with substantially less training time or data. We propose
a factorized preconditioning architecture that reduces NF complexity by
combining a linear component with a conditional NF, improving adaptability to
target geometry. The linear preconditioner is applied to dimensions that are
approximately Gaussian, as estimated from warmup samples, while the conditional
NF models more complex dimensions. Our method yields significantly better tail
samples on two complex synthetic distributions and consistently better
performance on a sparse logistic regression posterior across varying likelihood
and prior strengths. It also achieves higher effective sample sizes on
hierarchical Bayesian model posteriors with weak likelihoods and strong funnel
geometries. This approach is particularly relevant for hierarchical Bayesian
model analyses with limited data and could inform current theoretical and
software strides in neural MCMC design.

Abstract: We introduce a lightweight, real-time motion recognition system that enables
synergic human-machine performance through wearable IMU sensor data, MiniRocket
time-series classification, and responsive multimedia control. By mapping
dancer-specific movement to sound through somatic memory and association, we
propose an alternative approach to human-machine collaboration, one that
preserves the expressive depth of the performing body while leveraging machine
learning for attentive observation and responsiveness. We demonstrate that this
human-centered design reliably supports high accuracy classification (<50 ms
latency), offering a replicable framework to integrate dance-literate machines
into creative, educational, and live performance contexts.

Abstract: Graph neural networks have shown remarkable success in exploiting the spatial
and temporal patterns on dynamic graphs. However, existing GNNs exhibit poor
generalization ability under distribution shifts, which is inevitable in
dynamic scenarios. As dynamic graph generation progresses amid evolving latent
non-stationary environments, it is imperative to explore their effects on
out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. This paper proposes a novel Evolving
Graph Learning framework for OOD generalization (EvoOOD) by environment-aware
invariant pattern recognition. Specifically, we first design an environment
sequential variational auto-encoder to model environment evolution and infer
the underlying environment distribution. Then, we introduce a mechanism for
environment-aware invariant pattern recognition, tailored to address
environmental diversification through inferred distributions. Finally, we
conduct fine-grained causal interventions on individual nodes using a mixture
of instantiated environment samples. This approach helps to distinguish
spatio-temporal invariant patterns for OOD prediction, especially in
non-stationary environments. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority
of EvoGOOD on both real-world and synthetic dynamic datasets under distribution
shifts. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first attempt to study the
dynamic graph OOD generalization problem from the environment evolution
perspective.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as the dominant paradigm for
grounding large language model outputs in verifiable evidence. However, as
modern AI agents transition from static knowledge bases to continuous
multimodal streams encompassing text, images, video, and audio, two critical
challenges arise: maintaining index freshness without prohibitive re-indexing
costs, and preserving cross-modal semantic consistency across heterogeneous
embedding spaces. We present LUMA-RAG, a lifelong multimodal agent architecture
featuring three key innovations: (i) a streaming, multi-tier memory system that
dynamically spills embeddings from a hot HNSW tier to a compressed IVFPQ tier
under strict memory budgets; (ii) a streaming CLAP->CLIP alignment bridge that
maintains cross-modal consistency through incremental orthogonal Procrustes
updates; and (iii) stability-aware retrieval telemetry providing Safe@k
guarantees by jointly bounding alignment drift and quantization error.
Experiments demonstrate robust text-to-image retrieval (Recall@10 = 0.94),
graceful performance degradation under product quantization offloading, and
provably stable audio-to-image rankings (Safe@1 = 1.0), establishing LUMA-RAG
as a practical framework for production multimodal RAG systems.

Abstract: Early detection of heart arrhythmia can prevent severe future complications
in cardiac patients. While manual diagnosis still remains the clinical
standard, it relies heavily on visual interpretation and is inherently
subjective. In recent years, deep learning has emerged as a powerful tool to
automate arrhythmia detection, offering improved accuracy, consistency, and
efficiency. Several variants of convolutional and recurrent neural network
architectures have been widely explored to capture spatial and temporal
patterns in physiological signals. However, despite these advancements, current
models often struggle to generalize well in real-world scenarios, especially
when dealing with small or noisy datasets, which are common challenges in
biomedical applications. In this paper, a novel CNN-H-Infinity-LSTM
architecture is proposed to identify arrhythmic heart signals from heart sound
recordings. This architecture introduces trainable parameters inspired by the
H-Infinity filter from control theory, enhancing robustness and generalization.
Extensive experimentation on the PhysioNet CinC Challenge 2016 dataset, a
public benchmark of heart audio recordings, demonstrates that the proposed
model achieves stable convergence and outperforms existing benchmarks, with a
test accuracy of 99.42% and an F1 score of 98.85%.

Abstract: We present a novel decentralized algorithm for coverage control in unknown
spatial environments modeled by Gaussian Processes (GPs). To trade-off between
exploration and exploitation, each agent autonomously determines its trajectory
by minimizing a local cost function. Inspired by the GP-UCB (Upper Confidence
Bound for GPs) acquisition function, the proposed cost combines the expected
locational cost with a variance-based exploration term, guiding agents toward
regions that are both high in predicted density and model uncertainty. Compared
to previous work, our algorithm operates in a fully decentralized fashion,
relying only on local observations and communication with neighboring agents.
In particular, agents periodically update their inducing points using a greedy
selection strategy, enabling scalable online GP updates. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our algorithm in simulation.

Abstract: We formulate the machine unlearning problem as a general constrained
optimization problem. It unifies the first-order methods from the approximate
machine unlearning literature. This paper then introduces the concept of
feasible updates as the model's parameter update directions that help with
unlearning while not degrading the utility of the initial model. Our design of
feasible updates is based on masking, \ie\ a careful selection of the model's
parameters worth updating. It also takes into account the estimation noise of
the gradients when processing each batch of data to offer a statistical
guarantee to derive locally feasible updates. The technique can be plugged in,
as an add-on, to any first-order approximate unlearning methods. Experiments
with computer vision classifiers validate this approach.

Abstract: Machine learning methods are increasingly applied in medical imaging, yet
many reported improvements lack statistical robustness: recent works have
highlighted that small but significant performance gains are highly likely to
be false positives. However, these analyses do not take
\emph{underspecification} into account -- the fact that models achieving
similar validation scores may behave differently on unseen data due to random
initialization or training dynamics. Here, we extend a recent statistical
framework modeling false outperformance claims to include underspecification as
an additional variance component. Our simulations demonstrate that even modest
seed variability ($\sim1\%$) substantially increases the evidence required to
support superiority claims. Our findings underscore the need for explicit
modeling of training variance when validating medical imaging systems.

Abstract: Knowledge graph embedding (KGE) has become a fundamental technique for
representation learning on multi-relational data. Many seminal models, such as
TransE, operate in an unbounded Euclidean space, which presents inherent
limitations in modeling complex relations and can lead to inefficient training.
In this paper, we propose Spherical Knowledge Graph Embedding (SKGE), a model
that challenges this paradigm by constraining entity representations to a
compact manifold: a hypersphere. SKGE employs a learnable, non-linear
Spherization Layer to map entities onto the sphere and interprets relations as
a hybrid translate-then-project transformation. Through extensive experiments
on three benchmark datasets, FB15k-237, CoDEx-S, and CoDEx-M, we demonstrate
that SKGE consistently and significantly outperforms its strong Euclidean
counterpart, TransE, particularly on large-scale benchmarks such as FB15k-237
and CoDEx-M, demonstrating the efficacy of the spherical geometric prior. We
provide an in-depth analysis to reveal the sources of this advantage, showing
that this geometric constraint acts as a powerful regularizer, leading to
comprehensive performance gains across all relation types. More fundamentally,
we prove that the spherical geometry creates an "inherently hard negative
sampling" environment, naturally eliminating trivial negatives and forcing the
model to learn more robust and semantically coherent representations. Our
findings compellingly demonstrate that the choice of manifold is not merely an
implementation detail but a fundamental design principle, advocating for
geometric priors as a cornerstone for designing the next generation of powerful
and stable KGE models.

Abstract: Partial differential equations (PDEs) underpin quantitative descriptions
across the physical sciences and engineering, yet high-fidelity simulation
remains a major computational bottleneck for many-query, real-time, and design
tasks. Data-driven surrogates can be strikingly fast but are often unreliable
when applied outside their training distribution. Here we introduce Neural
Operator Warm Starts (NOWS), a hybrid strategy that harnesses learned solution
operators to accelerate classical iterative solvers by producing high-quality
initial guesses for Krylov methods such as conjugate gradient and GMRES. NOWS
leaves existing discretizations and solver infrastructures intact, integrating
seamlessly with finite-difference, finite-element, isogeometric analysis,
finite volume method, etc. Across our benchmarks, the learned initialization
consistently reduces iteration counts and end-to-end runtime, resulting in a
reduction of the computational time of up to 90 %, while preserving the
stability and convergence guarantees of the underlying numerical algorithms. By
combining the rapid inference of neural operators with the rigor of traditional
solvers, NOWS provides a practical and trustworthy approach to accelerate
high-fidelity PDE simulations.

Abstract: As the global burden of Alzheimer's disease (AD) continues to grow, early and
accurate detection has become increasingly critical, especially in regions with
limited access to advanced diagnostic tools. We propose BRAINS (Biomedical
Retrieval-Augmented Intelligence for Neurodegeneration Screening) to address
this challenge. This novel system harnesses the powerful reasoning capabilities
of Large Language Models (LLMs) for Alzheimer's detection and monitoring.
BRAINS features a dual-module architecture: a cognitive diagnostic module and a
case-retrieval module. The Diagnostic Module utilizes LLMs fine-tuned on
cognitive and neuroimaging datasets -- including MMSE, CDR scores, and brain
volume metrics -- to perform structured assessments of Alzheimer's risk.
Meanwhile, the Case Retrieval Module encodes patient profiles into latent
representations and retrieves similar cases from a curated knowledge base.
These auxiliary cases are fused with the input profile via a Case Fusion Layer
to enhance contextual understanding. The combined representation is then
processed with clinical prompts for inference. Evaluations on real-world
datasets demonstrate BRAINS effectiveness in classifying disease severity and
identifying early signs of cognitive decline. This system not only shows strong
potential as an assistive tool for scalable, explainable, and early-stage
Alzheimer's disease detection, but also offers hope for future applications in
the field.

Abstract: We propose a unified information-geometric framework that formalizes
understanding in learning as a trade-off between informativeness and geometric
simplicity. An encoder phi is evaluated by U(phi) = I(phi(X); Y) - beta *
C(phi), where C(phi) penalizes curvature and intrinsic dimensionality,
enforcing smooth, low-complexity manifolds. Under mild manifold and regularity
assumptions, we derive non-asymptotic bounds showing that generalization error
scales with intrinsic dimension while curvature controls approximation
stability, directly linking geometry to sample efficiency. To operationalize
this theory, we introduce the Variational Geometric Information Bottleneck
(V-GIB), a variational estimator that unifies mutual-information compression
and curvature regularization through tractable geometric proxies such as the
Hutchinson trace, Jacobian norms, and local PCA. Experiments across synthetic
manifolds, few-shot settings, and real-world datasets (Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10)
reveal a robust information-geometry Pareto frontier, stable estimators, and
substantial gains in interpretive efficiency. Fractional-data experiments on
CIFAR-10 confirm that curvature-aware encoders maintain predictive power under
data scarcity, validating the predicted efficiency-curvature law. Overall,
V-GIB provides a principled and measurable route to representations that are
geometrically coherent, data-efficient, and aligned with human-understandable
structure.

Abstract: The capacitated location-routing problems (CLRPs) are classical problems in
combinatorial optimization, which require simultaneously making location and
routing decisions. In CLRPs, the complex constraints and the intricate
relationships between various decisions make the problem challenging to solve.
With the emergence of deep reinforcement learning (DRL), it has been
extensively applied to address the vehicle routing problem and its variants,
while the research related to CLRPs still needs to be explored. In this paper,
we propose the DRL with heterogeneous query (DRLHQ) to solve CLRP and open CLRP
(OCLRP), respectively. We are the first to propose an end-to-end learning
approach for CLRPs, following the encoder-decoder structure. In particular, we
reformulate the CLRPs as a markov decision process tailored to various
decisions, a general modeling framework that can be adapted to other DRL-based
methods. To better handle the interdependency across location and routing
decisions, we also introduce a novel heterogeneous querying attention mechanism
designed to adapt dynamically to various decision-making stages. Experimental
results on both synthetic and benchmark datasets demonstrate superior solution
quality and better generalization performance of our proposed approach over
representative traditional and DRL-based baselines in solving both CLRP and
OCLRP.

Abstract: Healthcare artificial intelligence systems routinely fail when deployed
across institutions, with documented performance drops and perpetuation of
discriminatory patterns embedded in historical data. This brittleness stems, in
part, from learning statistical associations rather than causal mechanisms.
Causal graph neural networks address this triple crisis of distribution shift,
discrimination, and inscrutability by combining graph-based representations of
biomedical data with causal inference principles to learn invariant mechanisms
rather than spurious correlations. This Review examines methodological
foundations spanning structural causal models, disentangled causal
representation learning, and techniques for interventional prediction and
counterfactual reasoning on graphs. We analyse applications demonstrating
clinical value across psychiatric diagnosis through brain network analysis,
cancer subtyping via multi-omics causal integration, continuous physiological
monitoring with mechanistic interpretation, and drug recommendation correcting
prescription bias. These advances establish foundations for patient-specific
Causal Digital Twins, enabling in silico clinical experimentation, with
integration of large language models for hypothesis generation and causal graph
neural networks for mechanistic validation. Substantial barriers remain,
including computational requirements precluding real-time deployment,
validation challenges demanding multi-modal evidence triangulation beyond
cross-validation, and risks of causal-washing where methods employ causal
terminology without rigorous evidentiary support. We propose tiered frameworks
distinguishing causally-inspired architectures from causally-validated
discoveries and identify critical research priorities making causal rather than
purely associational claims.

stable matchings may fail to exist. To address this, we propose alternative
solution concepts based on Rawlsian fairness, aiming to maximize the minimum
utility across colleges. We design both deterministic and stochastic algorithms
that iteratively improve the outcome of the worst-off college, offering a
practical approach to fair allocation when stability cannot be guaranteed.

Abstract: We investigate theoretical guarantees for the false-negative rate (FNR) --
the fraction of true causal edges whose orientation is not recovered, under
single-variable random interventions and an $\epsilon$-interventional
faithfulness assumption that accommodates latent confounding. For sparse
Erd\H{o}s--R\'enyi directed acyclic graphs, where the edge probability scales
as $p_e = \Theta(1/d)$, we show that the FNR concentrates around its mean at
rate $O(\frac{\log d}{\sqrt d})$, implying that large deviations above the
expected error become exponentially unlikely as dimensionality increases. This
concentration ensures that derived upper bounds hold with high probability in
large-scale settings. Extending the analysis to generalized Barab\'asi--Albert
graphs reveals an even stronger phenomenon: when the degree exponent satisfies
$\gamma > 3$, the deviation width scales as $O(d^{\beta - \frac{1}{2}})$ with
$\beta = 1/(\gamma - 1) < \frac{1}{2}$, and hence vanishes in the limit. This
demonstrates that realistic scale-free topologies intrinsically regularize
causal discovery, reducing variability in orientation error. These
finite-dimension results provide the first dimension-adaptive,
faithfulness-robust guarantees for causal structure recovery, and challenge the
intuition that high dimensionality and network heterogeneity necessarily hinder
accurate discovery. Our simulation results corroborate these theoretical
predictions, showing that the FNR indeed concentrates and often vanishes in
practice as dimensionality grows.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) suffers from extrapolation errors induced
by out-of-distribution (OOD) actions. To address this, offline RL algorithms
typically impose constraints on action selection, which can be systematically
categorized into density, support, and sample constraints. However, we show
that each category has inherent limitations: density and sample constraints
tend to be overly conservative in many scenarios, while the support constraint,
though least restrictive, faces challenges in accurately modeling the behavior
policy. To overcome these limitations, we propose a new neighborhood constraint
that restricts action selection in the Bellman target to the union of
neighborhoods of dataset actions. Theoretically, the constraint not only bounds
extrapolation errors and distribution shift under certain conditions, but also
approximates the support constraint without requiring behavior policy modeling.
Moreover, it retains substantial flexibility and enables pointwise conservatism
by adapting the neighborhood radius for each data point. In practice, we employ
data quality as the adaptation criterion and design an adaptive neighborhood
constraint. Building on an efficient bilevel optimization framework, we develop
a simple yet effective algorithm, Adaptive Neighborhood-constrained Q learning
(ANQ), to perform Q learning with target actions satisfying this constraint.
Empirically, ANQ achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard offline RL
benchmarks and exhibits strong robustness in scenarios with noisy or limited
data.

Abstract: Hyperparameter optimization (HPO), for example, based on Bayesian
optimization (BO), supports users in designing models well-suited for a given
dataset. HPO has proven its effectiveness on several applications, ranging from
classical machine learning for tabular data to deep neural networks for
computer vision and transformers for natural language processing. However, HPO
still sometimes lacks acceptance by machine learning experts due to its
black-box nature and limited user control. Addressing this, first approaches
have been proposed to initialize BO methods with expert knowledge. However,
these approaches do not allow for online steering during the optimization
process. In this paper, we introduce a novel method that enables repeated
interventions to steer BO via user input, specifying expert knowledge and user
preferences at runtime of the HPO process in the form of prior distributions.
To this end, we generalize an existing method, $\pi$BO, preserving theoretical
guarantees. We also introduce a misleading prior detection scheme, which allows
protection against harmful user inputs. In our experimental evaluation, we
demonstrate that our method can effectively incorporate multiple priors,
leveraging informative priors, whereas misleading priors are reliably rejected
or overcome. Thereby, we achieve competitiveness to unperturbed BO.

Abstract: Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) is widely regarded as one of the most
successful deep reinforcement learning algorithms, known for its robustness and
effectiveness across a range of problems.
  The PPO objective encourages the importance ratio between the current and
behavior policies to move to the "right" direction -- starting from importance
sampling ratios equal to 1, increasing the ratios for actions with positive
advantages and decreasing those with negative advantages. A clipping function
is introduced to prevent over-optimization when updating the importance ratio
in these "right" direction regions. Many PPO variants have been proposed to
extend its success, most of which modify the objective's behavior by altering
the clipping in the "right" direction regions. However, due to randomness in
the rollouts and stochasticity of the policy optimization, we observe that the
ratios frequently move to the "wrong" direction during the PPO optimization.
This is a key factor hindering the improvement of PPO, but it has been largely
overlooked. To address this, we propose the Directional-Clamp PPO algorithm
(DClamp-PPO), which further penalizes the actions going to the strict "wrong"
direction regions, where the advantage is positive (negative) and importance
ratio falls below (above) $1 - \beta$ ($1+\beta$),
  for a tunable parameter $\beta \in (0, 1)$. The penalty is by enforcing a
steeper loss slope, i.e., a clamp, in those regions. We demonstrate that
DClamp-PPO consistently outperforms PPO, as well as its variants, by focusing
on modifying the objective's behavior in the "right" direction, across various
MuJoCo environments, using different random seeds. The proposed method is
shown, both theoretically and empirically, to better avoid "wrong" direction
updates while keeping the importance ratio closer to 1.

Abstract: The development of smart systems (i.e., systems enhanced with AI components)
has thrived thanks to the rapid advancements in neural networks (NNs). A wide
range of libraries and frameworks have consequently emerged to support NN
design and implementation. The choice depends on factors such as available
functionalities, ease of use, documentation and community support. After
adopting a given NN framework, organizations might later choose to switch to
another if performance declines, requirements evolve, or new features are
introduced. Unfortunately, migrating NN implementations across libraries is
challenging due to the lack of migration approaches specifically tailored for
NNs. This leads to increased time and effort to modernize NNs, as manual
updates are necessary to avoid relying on outdated implementations and ensure
compatibility with new features. In this paper, we propose an approach to
automatically migrate neural network code across deep learning frameworks. Our
method makes use of a pivot NN model to create an abstraction of the NN prior
to migration. We validate our approach using two popular NN frameworks, namely
PyTorch and TensorFlow. We also discuss the challenges of migrating code
between the two frameworks and how they were approached in our method.
Experimental evaluation on five NNs shows that our approach successfully
migrates their code and produces NNs that are functionally equivalent to the
originals. Artefacts from our work are available online.

the manifold. They are trained to act as identity operators on the data and as
idempotent operators off the data manifold. However, IGNs suffer from mode
collapse, mode dropping, and training instability due to their objectives,
which contain adversarial components and can cause the model to cover the data
manifold only partially -- an issue shared with generative adversarial
networks. We introduce Non-Adversarial Idempotent Generative Networks (NAIGNs)
to address these issues. Our loss function combines reconstruction with the
non-adversarial generative objective of Implicit Maximum Likelihood Estimation
(IMLE). This improves on IGN's ability to restore corrupted data and generate
new samples that closely match the data distribution. We moreover demonstrate
that NAIGNs implicitly learn the distance field to the data manifold, as well
as an energy-based model.

Abstract: We study computable probably approximately correct (CPAC) learning, where
learners are required to be computable functions. It had been previously
observed that the Fundamental Theorem of Statistical Learning, which
characterizes PAC learnability by finiteness of the Vapnik-Chervonenkis
(VC-)dimension, no longer holds in this framework. Recent works recovered
analogs of the Fundamental Theorem in the computable setting, for instance by
introducing an effective VC-dimension. Guided by this, we investigate the
connection between CPAC learning and recursively enumerable representable (RER)
classes, whose members can be algorithmically listed. Our results show that the
effective VC-dimensions can take arbitrary values above the traditional one,
even for RER classes, which creates a whole family of (non-)examples for
various notions of CPAC learning. Yet the two dimensions coincide for classes
satisfying sufficiently strong notions of CPAC learning. We then observe that
CPAC learnability can also be characterized via containment of RER classes that
realize the same samples. Furthermore, it is shown that CPAC learnable classes
satisfying a unique identification property are necessarily RER. Finally, we
establish that agnostic learnability can be guaranteed for RER classes, by
considering the relaxed notion of nonuniform CPAC learning.

Abstract: We introduce GasRL, a simulator that couples a calibrated representation of
the natural gas market with a model of storage-operator policies trained with
deep reinforcement learning (RL). We use it to analyse how optimal stockpile
management affects equilibrium prices and the dynamics of demand and supply. We
test various RL algorithms and find that Soft Actor Critic (SAC) exhibits
superior performance in the GasRL environment: multiple objectives of storage
operators - including profitability, robust market clearing and price
stabilisation - are successfully achieved. Moreover, the equilibrium price
dynamics induced by SAC-derived optimal policies have characteristics, such as
volatility and seasonality, that closely match those of real-world prices.
Remarkably, this adherence to the historical distribution of prices is obtained
without explicitly calibrating the model to price data. We show how the
simulator can be used to assess the effects of EU-mandated minimum storage
thresholds. We find that such thresholds have a positive effect on market
resilience against unanticipated shifts in the distribution of supply shocks.
For example, with unusually large shocks, market disruptions are averted more
often if a threshold is in place.

Abstract: We investigate robust federated learning, where a group of workers
collaboratively train a shared model under the orchestration of a central
server in the presence of Byzantine adversaries capable of arbitrary and
potentially malicious behaviors. To simultaneously enhance communication
efficiency and robustness against such adversaries, we propose a
Byzantine-resilient Nesterov-Accelerated Federated Learning (Byrd-NAFL)
algorithm. Byrd-NAFL seamlessly integrates Nesterov's momentum into the
federated learning process alongside Byzantine-resilient aggregation rules to
achieve fast and safeguarding convergence against gradient corruption. We
establish a finite-time convergence guarantee for Byrd-NAFL under non-convex
and smooth loss functions with relaxed assumption on the aggregated gradients.
Extensive numerical experiments validate the effectiveness of Byrd-NAFL and
demonstrate the superiority over existing benchmarks in terms of convergence
speed, accuracy, and resilience to diverse Byzantine attack strategies.

Abstract: Focusing on implicit neural representations, we present a novel in situ
training protocol that employs limited memory buffers of full and sketched data
samples, where the sketched data are leveraged to prevent catastrophic
forgetting. The theoretical motivation for our use of sketching as a
regularizer is presented via a simple Johnson-Lindenstrauss-informed result.
While our methods may be of wider interest in the field of continual learning,
we specifically target in situ neural compression using implicit neural
representation-based hypernetworks. We evaluate our method on a variety of
complex simulation data in two and three dimensions, over long time horizons,
and across unstructured grids and non-Cartesian geometries. On these tasks, we
show strong reconstruction performance at high compression rates. Most
importantly, we demonstrate that sketching enables the presented in situ scheme
to approximately match the performance of the equivalent offline method.

Abstract: Compositional generalization-a key open challenge in modern machine
learning-requires models to predict unknown combinations of known concepts.
However, assessing compositional generalization remains a fundamental challenge
due to the lack of standardized evaluation protocols and the limitations of
current benchmarks, which often favor efficiency over rigor. At the same time,
general-purpose vision architectures lack the necessary inductive biases, and
existing approaches to endow them compromise scalability. As a remedy, this
paper introduces: 1) a rigorous evaluation framework that unifies and extends
previous approaches while reducing computational requirements from
combinatorial to constant; 2) an extensive and modern evaluation on the status
of compositional generalization in supervised vision backbones, training more
than 5000 models; 3) Attribute Invariant Networks, a class of models
establishing a new Pareto frontier in compositional generalization, achieving a
23.43% accuracy improvement over baselines while reducing parameter overhead
from 600% to 16% compared to fully disentangled counterparts.

Abstract: Training agents to operate under strict constraints during deployment, such
as limited resource budgets or stringent safety requirements, presents
significant challenges, especially when these constraints render the task
complex. In this work, we propose a curriculum learning strategy that gradually
tightens constraints during training, enabling the agent to incrementally
master the deployment requirements. Inspired by self-paced learning techniques
in unconstrained reinforcement learning (RL), our approach facilitates a
smoother transition to challenging environments by initially training on
simplified versions of the constraints and progressively introducing the full
deployment conditions. We provide a theoretical analysis using an RL agent in a
binary-tree Markov Decision Process (MDP) to demonstrate that our curriculum
strategy can accelerate training relative to a baseline approach that imposes
the trajectory constraints from the outset. Moreover, we empirically validate
the effectiveness and generality of our method across both RL and large
language model (LLM) agents in diverse settings, including a binary-tree MDP, a
multi-task navigation domain, and a math reasoning task with two benchmarks.
These results highlight the potential of curriculum design in enhancing the
efficiency and performance of agents operating under complex trajectory
constraints during deployment. Moreover, when applied to LLMs, our strategy
enables compression of output chain-of-thought tokens, achieving a substantial
inference speedup on consumer hardware, demonstrating its effectiveness for
resource-constrained deployment.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Knowledge tracing (KT) models are a crucial basis for pedagogical
decision-making, namely which task to select next for a learner and when to
stop teaching a particular skill. Given the high stakes of pedagogical
decisions, KT models are typically required to be interpretable, in the sense
that they should implement an explicit model of human learning and provide
explicit estimates of learners' abilities. However, to our knowledge, no study
to date has investigated whether the interpretability of KT models actually
helps human teachers to make teaching decisions. We address this gap. First, we
perform a simulation study to show that, indeed, decisions based on
interpretable KT models achieve mastery faster compared to decisions based on a
non-interpretable model. Second, we repeat the study but ask $N=12$ human
teachers to make the teaching decisions based on the information provided by KT
models. As expected, teachers rate interpretable KT models higher in terms of
usability and trustworthiness. However, the number of tasks needed until
mastery hardly differs between KT models. This suggests that the relationship
between model interpretability and teacher decisions is not straightforward:
teachers do not solely rely on KT models to make decisions and further research
is needed to investigate how learners and teachers actually understand and use
KT models.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Mislabeled data is a pervasive issue that undermines the performance of
machine learning systems in real-world applications. An effective approach to
mitigate this problem is to detect mislabeled instances and subject them to
special treatment, such as filtering or relabeling. Automatic mislabeling
detection methods typically rely on training a base machine learning model and
then probing it for each instance to obtain a trust score that each provided
label is genuine or incorrect. The properties of this base model are thus of
paramount importance. In this paper, we investigate the impact of calibrating
this model. Our empirical results show that using calibration methods improves
the accuracy and robustness of mislabeled instance detection, providing a
practical and effective solution for industrial applications.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Zeroth-order or derivative-free optimization (MeZO) is an attractive strategy
for finetuning large language models (LLMs) because it eliminates the memory
overhead of backpropagation. However, it converges slowly due to the inherent
curse of dimensionality when searching for descent directions in the
high-dimensional parameter space of billion-scale LLMs. We propose ConMeZO, a
novel zeroth-order optimizer that accelerates convergence by adaptive
directional sampling. Instead of drawing the direction uniformly at random,
ConMeZO restricts the sampling to a cone centered around a momentum estimate.
This concentrates the search in directions where the true gradient is more
likely to lie and thus reduces the effect of high dimensions. We prove that
ConMeZO achieves the same worst-case convergence rate as MeZO. Empirically,
when finetuning LLMs on natural language tasks, ConMeZO is up to 2X faster than
MeZO while retaining the low-memory footprint of zeroth-order methods.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Recently, the ChannelComp framework has proposed digital over-the-air
computation by designing digital modulations that enable the computation of
arbitrary functions. Unlike traditional analog over-the-air computation, which
is restricted to nomographic functions, ChannelComp enables a broader range of
computational tasks while maintaining compatibility with digital communication
systems. This framework is intended for applications that favor local
information processing over the mere acquisition of data. However, ChannelComp
is currently designed for scalar function computation, while numerous
data-centric applications necessitate vector-based computations, and it is
susceptible to channel fading. In this work, we introduce a generalization of
the ChannelComp framework, called VecComp, by integrating ChannelComp with
multiple-antenna technology. This generalization not only enables vector
function computation but also ensures scalability in the computational
complexity, which increases only linearly with the vector dimension. As such,
VecComp remains computationally efficient and robust against channel
impairments, making it suitable for high-dimensional, data-centric
applications. We establish a non-asymptotic upper bound on the mean squared
error of VecComp, affirming its computation efficiency under fading channel
conditions. Numerical experiments show the effectiveness of VecComp in
improving the computation of vector functions and fading compensation over
noisy and fading multiple-access channels.

Abstract: The chemical space of drug-like molecules is vast, motivating the development
of generative models that must learn broad chemical distributions, enable
conditional generation by capturing structure-property representations, and
provide fast molecular generation. Meeting the objectives depends on modeling
choices, including the probabilistic modeling approach, the conditional
generative formulation, the architecture, and the molecular input
representation. To address the challenges, we present STAR-VAE
(Selfies-encoded, Transformer-based, AutoRegressive Variational Auto Encoder),
a scalable latent-variable framework with a Transformer encoder and an
autoregressive Transformer decoder. It is trained on 79 million drug-like
molecules from PubChem, using SELFIES to guarantee syntactic validity. The
latent-variable formulation enables conditional generation: a property
predictor supplies a conditioning signal that is applied consistently to the
latent prior, the inference network, and the decoder. Our contributions are:
(i) a Transformer-based latent-variable encoder-decoder model trained on
SELFIES representations; (ii) a principled conditional latent-variable
formulation for property-guided generation; and (iii) efficient finetuning with
low-rank adapters (LoRA) in both encoder and decoder, enabling fast adaptation
with limited property and activity data. On the GuacaMol and MOSES benchmarks,
our approach matches or exceeds baselines, and latent-space analyses reveal
smooth, semantically structured representations that support both unconditional
exploration and property-aware generation. On the Tartarus benchmarks, the
conditional model shifts docking-score distributions toward stronger predicted
binding. These results suggest that a modernized, scale-appropriate VAE remains
competitive for molecular generation when paired with principled conditioning
and parameter-efficient finetuning.

Abstract: Despite the popularity of the Adam optimizer in practice, most theoretical
analyses study Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) as a proxy for Adam, and
little is known about how the solutions found by Adam differ. In this paper, we
show that Adam implicitly reduces a unique form of sharpness measure shaped by
its adaptive updates, leading to qualitatively different solutions from SGD.
More specifically, when the training loss is small, Adam wanders around the
manifold of minimizers and takes semi-gradients to minimize this sharpness
measure in an adaptive manner, a behavior we rigorously characterize through a
continuous-time approximation using stochastic differential equations. We
further demonstrate how this behavior differs from that of SGD in a
well-studied setting: when training overparameterized models with label noise,
SGD has been shown to minimize the trace of the Hessian matrix, $\tr(\mH)$,
whereas we prove that Adam minimizes $\tr(\Diag(\mH)^{1/2})$ instead. In
solving sparse linear regression with diagonal linear networks, this
distinction enables Adam to achieve better sparsity and generalization than
SGD. Finally, our analysis framework extends beyond Adam to a broad class of
adaptive gradient methods, including RMSProp, Adam-mini, Adalayer and Shampoo,
and provides a unified perspective on how these adaptive optimizers reduce
sharpness, which we hope will offer insights for future optimizer design.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a widely used method for training machine learning
(ML) models in a scalable way while preserving privacy (i.e., without
centralizing raw data). Prior research shows that the risk of exposing
sensitive data increases cumulatively as the number of iterations where a
client's updates are included in the aggregated model increase. Attackers can
launch membership inference attacks (MIA; deciding whether a sample or client
participated), property inference attacks (PIA; inferring attributes of a
client's data), and model inversion attacks (MI; reconstructing inputs),
thereby inferring client-specific attributes and, in some cases, reconstructing
inputs. In this paper, we mitigate risk by substantially reducing per client
exposure using a quantum computing-inspired quadratic unconstrained binary
optimization (QUBO) formulation that selects a small subset of client updates
most relevant for each training round. In this work, we focus on two threat
vectors: (i) information leakage by clients during training and (ii)
adversaries who can query or obtain the global model. We assume a trusted
central server and do not model server compromise. This method also assumes
that the server has access to a validation/test set with global data
distribution. Experiments on the MNIST dataset with 300 clients in 20 rounds
showed a 95.2% per-round and 49% cumulative privacy exposure reduction, with
147 clients' updates never being used during training while maintaining in
general the full-aggregation accuracy or even better. The method proved to be
efficient at lower scale and more complex model as well. A CINIC-10
dataset-based experiment with 30 clients resulted in 82% per-round privacy
improvement and 33% cumulative privacy.

Abstract: We present a systematic study of subtraction in large language models (LLMs).
While prior benchmarks emphasize addition and multiplication, subtraction has
received comparatively little attention despite being structurally distinct as
a non-commutative operation. We evaluate eight pretrained LLMs spanning four
families on addition and subtraction problems. Our experiments reveal that
subtraction accuracy lags behind addition by a wide margin. We find that the
errors for ($a-b$) are concentrated in cases where ($a<b$). In such cases, LLMs
frequently produce the correct magnitude but omit the negative sign. Probing
analyses show that LLMs internally encode whether results should be negative,
yet this information is often not reflected in generated outputs. We further
test well-known techniques such as few-shot learning and instruction-tuning to
see if they can improve the LLMs' performance. Our results suggest that while
few-shot prompting yields modest gains, the instruction-tuned models achieve
near-perfect accuracies in generating the negative sign. Together, these
findings provide a clearer characterization of the limitations and
recoverability of LLMs' arithmetic capabilities in subtraction.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed training paradigm wherein
participants collaborate to build a global model while ensuring the privacy of
the involved data, which remains stored on participant devices. However,
proposals aiming to ensure such privacy also make it challenging to protect
against potential attackers seeking to compromise the training outcome. In this
context, we present Fast, Private, and Protected (FPP), a novel approach that
aims to safeguard federated training while enabling secure aggregation to
preserve data privacy. This is accomplished by evaluating rounds using
participants' assessments and enabling training recovery after an attack. FPP
also employs a reputation-based mechanism to mitigate the participation of
attackers. We created a dockerized environment to validate the performance of
FPP compared to other approaches in the literature (FedAvg, Power-of-Choice,
and aggregation via Trimmed Mean and Median). Our experiments demonstrate that
FPP achieves a rapid convergence rate and can converge even in the presence of
malicious participants performing model poisoning attacks.

Abstract: Tabular foundation models represent a growing paradigm in structured data

However, their adoption remains limited due to heterogeneous preprocessing

calibration and fairness. We present TabTune, a unified library that
standardizes the complete workflow for tabular foundation models through a
single interface. TabTune provides consistent access to seven state-of-the-art
models supporting multiple adaptation strategies, including zero-shot
inference, meta-learning, supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and parameter-efficient
fine-tuning (PEFT). The framework automates model-aware preprocessing, manages
architectural heterogeneity internally, and integrates evaluation modules for
performance, calibration, and fairness. Designed for extensibility and
reproducibility, TabTune enables consistent benchmarking of adaptation
strategies of tabular foundation models. The library is open source and

machine learning models for predicting the winning team of any given game. We
extend this work by training a comprehensive set of machine learning models
using a common dataset. In addition, we relate the win probabilities produced

we show that the most common machine learning models do indeed demonstrate a
relationship between predicted win probability and the strength of the win.
Finally, we analyze the results of using predicted win probabilities as a
decision making mechanism on run-line betting. We demonstrate positive returns
when utilizing appropriate betting strategies, and show that naive use of
machine learning models for betting lead to significant loses.

Abstract: The number and diversity of remote sensing satellites grows over time, while
the vast majority of labeled data comes from older satellites. As the
foundation models for Earth observation scale up, the cost of (re-)training to
support new satellites grows too, so the generalization capabilities of the
models towards new satellites become increasingly important. In this work we
introduce GeoCrossBench, an extension of the popular GeoBench benchmark with a
new evaluation protocol: it tests the in-distribution performance;
generalization to satellites with no band overlap; and generalization to
satellites with additional bands with respect to the training set. We also
develop a self-supervised extension of ChannelViT, ChiViT, to improve its
cross-satellite performance. First, we show that even the best foundation
models for remote sensing (DOFA, TerraFM) do not outperform general purpose
models like DINOv3 in the in-distribution setting. Second, when generalizing to
new satellites with no band overlap, all models suffer 2-4x drop in
performance, and ChiViT significantly outperforms the runner-up DINOv3. Third,
the performance of all tested models drops on average by 5-25\% when given
additional bands during test time. Finally, we show that fine-tuning just the
last linear layer of these models using oracle labels from all bands can get
relatively consistent performance across all satellites, highlighting that the
benchmark is far from being saturated. We publicly release the code and the
datasets to encourage the development of more future-proof remote sensing
models with stronger cross-satellite generalization.

Abstract: Cloud is now the leading software and computing hardware innovator, and is
changing the landscape of compute to one that is optimized for artificial
intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML). Computing innovation was initially
driven to meet the needs of scientific computing. As industry and consumer
usage of computing proliferated, there was a shift to satisfy a multipolar
customer base. Demand for AI/ML now dominates modern computing and innovation
has centralized on cloud. As a result, cost and resource models designed to
serve AI/ML use cases are not currently well suited for science. If resource
contention resulting from a unipole consumer makes access to contended
resources harder for scientific users, a likely future is running scientific

Abstract: We study shortest-path routing in large weighted, undirected graphs, where
expanding search frontiers raise time and memory costs for exact solvers. We
propose \emph{SPHERE}, a source-target-aware heuristic that identifies an
$s$-$t$ overlap: vertices that are close to both $s$ and $t$ in hop count.
Selecting an anchor $a$ in this overlap partitions the task into two
subproblems with unchanged problem-topology, $s\to a$ and $a\to t$; if either
remains large, the procedure recurses on its induced subgraph. Because the cut
lies inside the overlap, concatenating the resulting subpaths yields a valid
$s\to t$ route without boundary repair. SPHERE is independent of the downstream
solver (e.g., Dijkstra) and exposes parallelism across subproblems. On large
networks, it achieves faster runtimes and smaller optimality gaps than
Louvain-based routing and a METIS-based pipeline, even on graphs with more than
a million nodes and edges, while also outperforming Dijkstra in runtime.

Abstract: Edge intelligence paradigm is increasingly demanded by the emerging
autonomous systems, such as robotics. Beyond ensuring privacy-preserving
operation and resilience in connectivity-limited environments, edge deployment
offers significant energy and cost advantages over cloud-based solutions.
However, deploying large language models (LLMs) for reasoning tasks on edge
GPUs faces critical challenges from strict latency constraints and limited
computational resources. To navigate these constraints, developers must balance
multiple design factors - choosing reasoning versus non-reasoning
architectures, selecting appropriate model sizes, allocating token budgets, and
applying test-time scaling strategies - to meet target latency and optimize
accuracy. Yet guidance on optimal combinations of these variables remains
scarce. In this work, we present EdgeReasoning, a comprehensive study
characterizing the deployment of reasoning LLMs on edge GPUs. We systematically
quantify latency-accuracy tradeoffs across various LLM architectures and model
sizes. We systematically evaluate prompt-based and model-tuning-based
techniques for reducing reasoning token length while maintaining performance
quality. We further profile test-time scaling methods with varying degrees of
parallelism to maximize accuracy under strict latency budgets. Through these
analyses, EdgeReasoning maps the Pareto frontier of achievable accuracy-latency
configurations, offering systematic guidance for optimal edge deployment of
reasoning LLMs.

Abstract: In the present paper, the models of structural analysis and evaluation of
efficiency indicators (reliability, fault tolerance, viability, and
flexibility) of a multi core processor with variable structure, equipped with
multi functional cores, are considered. Using logical probabilistic methods,
the following has been developed: models for evaluating the reliability and
fault tolerance of processor cores as multi functional elements; logical
probabilistic models of the shortest paths, flexibility, and performance
conditions for successful operation of multi core processors based on multi
functional cores; and models for estimating the reliability, fault tolerance,
and lifetime of multi core processors considering all possible states of

Abstract: Mapping a dataflow-graph of an ML model onto a reconfigurable system is
difficult, as different mappings have different throughputs and consume
resource constraints differently. To solve this, a model to evaluate the
throughput of mappings is necessary as measuring throughput completely is
expensive. Many use a hand-designed analytical model, relying on proxy features
or intuition, introducing error. We provide a Learned Approach that predicts
throughput 31%-52% more accurately over a variety of graphs. In addition, our
approach shows no accuracy degradation after removing performance annotations.
We show that using this approach results in 5.6% faster compiled graphs.

Abstract: Microservice architecture has become a dominant paradigm in application
development due to its advantages of being lightweight, flexible, and
resilient. Deploying microservice applications in the container-based cloud
enables fine-grained elastic resource allocation. Autoscaling is an effective
approach to dynamically adjust the resource provisioned to containers. However,
the intricate microservice dependencies and the deployment scheme of the
container-based cloud bring extra challenges of resource scaling. This article
proposes a novel autoscaling approach named HGraphScale. In particular,
HGraphScale captures microservice dependencies and the deployment scheme by a
newly designed hierarchical graph neural network, and makes effective scaling
actions for rapidly changing user requests workloads. Extensive experiments
based on real-world traces of user requests are conducted to evaluate the
effectiveness of HGraphScale. The experiment results show that the HGraphScale
outperforms existing state-of-the-art autoscaling approaches by reducing at
most 80.16\% of the average response time under a certain VM rental budget of
application providers.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Serverless computing provides infrastructure management and elastic
auto-scaling, therefore reducing operational overhead. By design serverless
functions are stateless, which means they typically leverage external remote
services to store and exchange data. Transferring data over a network typically
involves serialization and deserialization. These operations usually require
multiple data copies and transitions between user and kernel space, resulting
in overhead from context switching and memory allocation, contributing
significantly to increased latency and resource consumption. To address these
issues, we present Roadrunner, a sidecar shim that enables near-zero copy and
serialization-free data transfer between WebAssembly-based serverless
functions. Roadrunner reduces the multiple copies between user space and kernel
space by mapping the function memory and moving the data along a dedicated
virtual data hose, bypassing the costly processes of serialization and
deserialization. This approach reduces data movement overhead and context
switching, achieving near-native latency performance for WebAssembly-based
serverless functions. Our experimental results demonstrate that Roadrunner
significantly improves the inter-function communication latency from 44% up to
89%, reducing the serialization overhead in 97% of data transfer, and
increasing throughput by 69 times compared to state-of-the-art
WebAssembly-based serverless functions.

Abstract: ADMM-FFT is an iterative method with high reconstruction accuracy for
laminography but suffers from excessive computation time and large memory
consumption. We introduce mLR, which employs memoization to replace the
time-consuming Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) operations based on an unique
observation that similar FFT operations appear in iterations of ADMM-FFT. We
introduce a series of techniques to make the application of memoization to
ADMM-FFT performance-beneficial and scalable. We also introduce variable
offloading to save CPU memory and scale ADMM-FFT across GPUs within and across
nodes. Using mLR, we are able to scale ADMM-FFT on an input problem of
2Kx2Kx2K, which is the largest input problem laminography reconstruction has
ever worked on with the ADMM-FFT solution on limited memory; mLR brings 52.8%
performance improvement on average (up to 65.4%), compared to the original
ADMM-FFT.

Abstract: Geospatial decentralization is essential for blockchains, ensuring regulatory
resilience, robustness, and fairness. We empirically analyze five major Proof
of Stake (PoS) blockchains: Aptos, Avalanche, Ethereum, Solana, and Sui,
revealing that a few geographic regions dominate consensus voting power,
resulting in limited geospatial decentralization. To address this, we propose
Geospatially aware Proof of Stake (GPoS), which integrates geospatial diversity
with stake-based voting power. Experimental evaluation demonstrates an average
45% improvement in geospatial decentralization, as measured by the Gini
coefficient of Eigenvector centrality, while incurring minimal performance
overhead in BFT protocols, including HotStuff and CometBFT. These results
demonstrate that GPoS can improve geospatial decentralization {while, in our
experiments, incurring minimal overhead} to consensus performance.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to scale, their workloads
increasingly rely on distributed execution across multiple GPUs. However, the
conventional bulk synchronous parallel~(BSP) model used in such settings
introduces significant performance inefficiencies. To characterize these
bottlenecks, we introduce the ''Three Taxes'' (Bulk Synchronous, Inter-Kernel
Data Locality, and Kernel Launch Overhead) as an analytical framework. We
propose moving beyond the rigid BSP model to address key inefficiencies in
distributed GPU execution. By exploiting libraries like Iris for Triton, we
gain access to in-kernel communication primitives that enable the design of
novel fine-grained programming patterns, offering greater flexibility and
performance than traditional BSP-based approaches. These patterns
systematically eliminate the three taxes by creating direct, tile-level
producer-consumer pipelines and replacing global barriers with fine-grained
dataflow synchronization. Applying this methodology to critical kernels, from
the foundational All-Gather + general matrix multiplication operation to the
complex Flash Decode algorithm, we observe a 10-20% speedup in end-to-end
latency over BSP-based approaches, establishing a more programmable and
efficient paradigm for distributed LLM workloads.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Serving large generative models such as LLMs and multi- modal transformers
requires balancing user-facing SLOs (e.g., time-to-first-token,
time-between-tokens) with provider goals of efficiency and cost reduction.
Existing solutions rely on static provisioning or model-level autoscaling, both
of which treat the model as a monolith. This coarse-grained resource management
leads to degraded performance or significant resource underutilization due to
poor adaptability to dynamic inference traffic that is common online.
  The root cause of this inefficiency lies in the internal structure of
generative models: they are executed as graphs of interconnected operators.
Through detailed characterization and systematic analysis, we find that
operators are heterogeneous in their compute and memory footprints and exhibit
diverse sensitivity to workload and resource factors such as batch size,
sequence length, and traffic rate. This heterogeneity suggests that the
operator, rather than the entire model, is the right granularity for scaling
decisions.
  We propose an operator-level autoscaling framework, which allocates resources
at finer (operator)-granularity, optimizing the scaling, batching, and
placement based on individual operator profiles. Evaluated on production-scale
traces, our approach preserves SLOs with up to 40% fewer GPUs and 35% less
energy, or under fixed resources achieves 1.6x higher throughput with 5% less
energy. These results show that the operator, rather than the model, is
fundamentally a more effective unit for scaling large generative workloads.

Abstract: Computation of correlation functions is a key operation in Lattice quantum
chromodynamics (LQCD) simulations to extract nuclear physics observables. These
functions involve many binary batch tensor contractions, each tensor possibly
occupying hundreds of MBs of memory. Performing these contractions on GPU
accelerators poses the challenge of scheduling them as to optimize tensor reuse
and reduce data traffic. In this work we propose two fast novel scheduling
algorithms that reorder contractions to increase temporal locality via
input/intermediate tensor reuse. Our schedulers take advantage of
application-specific features, such as contractions being binary and locality
within contraction trees, to optimize the objective of minimizing peak memory.
We integrate them into the LQCD analysis software suite Redstar and improve
time-to-solution. Our schedulers attain upto 2.1x improvement in peak memory,
which is reflected by a reduction of upto 4.2x in evictions, upto 1.8x in data
traffic, resulting in upto 1.9x faster correlation function computation time.

Abstract: The field of autonomous driving technology is rapidly advancing, with deep
learning being a key component. Particularly in the field of sensing, 3D point
cloud data collected by LiDAR is utilized to run deep neural network models for
3D object detection. However, these state-of-the-art models are complex,
leading to longer processing times and increased power consumption on edge
devices. The objective of this study is to address these issues by leveraging
Split Computing, a distributed machine learning inference method. Split
Computing aims to lessen the computational burden on edge devices, thereby
reducing processing time and power consumption. Furthermore, it minimizes the
risk of data breaches by only transmitting intermediate data from the deep
neural network model. Experimental results show that splitting after
voxelization reduces the inference time by 70.8% and the edge device execution
time by 90.0%. When splitting within the network, the inference time is reduced
by up to 57.1%, and the edge device execution time is reduced by up to 69.5%.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are proliferating rapidly at the edge,
delivering intelligent capabilities across diverse application scenarios.
However, their practical deployment in collaborative scenarios confronts
fundamental challenges: privacy vulnerabilities, communication overhead, and
computational bottlenecks. To address these, we propose Federated Attention
(FedAttn), which integrates the federated paradigm into the self-attention
mechanism, creating a new distributed LLM inference framework that
simultaneously achieves privacy protection, communication efficiency, and
computational efficiency. FedAttn enables participants to perform local
self-attention over their own token representations while periodically
exchanging and aggregating Key-Value (KV) matrices across multiple Transformer
blocks, collaboratively generating LLM responses without exposing private
prompts. Further, we identify a structural duality between contextual
representation refinement in FedAttn and parameter optimization in FL across
private data, local computation, and global aggregation. This key insight
provides a principled foundation for systematically porting federated
optimization techniques to collaborative LLM inference. Building on this
framework, we theoretically analyze how local self-attention computation within
participants and heterogeneous token relevance among participants shape error
propagation dynamics across Transformer blocks. Moreover, we characterize the
fundamental trade-off between response quality and communication/computation
efficiency, which is governed by the synchronization interval and the number of
participants. Experimental results validate our theoretical analysis, and
reveal significant optimization opportunities through sparse attention and
adaptive KV aggregation, highlighting FedAttn's potential to deliver
scalability and efficiency in real-world edge deployments.

Abstract: Scientific computing in the exascale era demands increased computational
power to solve complex problems across various domains. With the rise of
heterogeneous computing architectures the need for vendor-agnostic, performance
portability frameworks has been highlighted. Libraries like Kokkos have become
essential for enabling high-performance computing applications to execute
efficiently across different hardware platforms with minimal code changes. In
this direction, this paper presents preliminary time-to-solution results for
two representative scientific computing applications: an N-body simulation and
a structured grid simulation. Both applications used a distributed memory
approach and hardware acceleration through four performance portability
frameworks: Kokkos, OpenMP, RAJA, and OCCA. Experiments conducted on a single
node of the Polaris supercomputer using four NVIDIA A100 GPUs revealed
significant performance variability among frameworks. OCCA demonstrated faster
execution times for small-scale validation problems, likely due to JIT
compilation, however its lack of optimized reduction algorithms may limit
scalability for larger simulations while using its out of the box API. OpenMP
performed poorly in the structured grid simulation most likely due to
inefficiencies in inter-node data synchronization and communication. These
findings highlight the need for further optimization to maximize each
framework's capabilities. Future work will focus on enhancing reduction
algorithms, data communication, memory management, as wells as performing
scalability studies, and a comprehensive statistical analysis to evaluate and
compare framework performance.

Abstract: Classical state-machine replication protocols, such as Paxos, rely on a
distinguished leader process to order commands. Unfortunately, this approach
makes the leader a single point of failure and increases the latency for
clients that are not co-located with it. As a response to these drawbacks,
Egalitarian Paxos introduced an alternative, leaderless approach, that allows
replicas to order commands collaboratively. Not relying on a single leader
allows the protocol to maintain non-zero throughput with up to $f$ crashes of
any processes out of a total of $n = 2f+1$. The protocol furthermore allows any
process to execute a command $c$ fast, in $2$ message delays, provided no more
than $e = \lceil\frac{f+1}{2}\rceil$ other processes fail, and all concurrently
submitted commands commute with $c$; the latter condition is often satisfied in
practical systems.
  Egalitarian Paxos has served as a foundation for many other replication
protocols. But unfortunately, the protocol is very complex, ambiguously
specified and suffers from nontrivial bugs. In this paper, we present EPaxos*
-- a simpler and correct variant of Egalitarian Paxos. Our key technical
contribution is a simpler failure-recovery algorithm, which we have rigorously
proved correct. Our protocol also generalizes Egalitarian Paxos to cover the
whole spectrum of failure thresholds $f$ and $e$ such that $n \ge \max\{2e+f-1,
2f+1\}$ -- the number of processes that we show to be optimal.
